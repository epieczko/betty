# Name: fullstack.developer

# Purpose:
Full-stack development orchestrator that guides end-to-end application development from requirements to deployment. Orchestrates backend, frontend, database, and deployment skills based on project requirements and chosen technology stack. Focuses on architecture, integration, and workflow rather than specific technology implementation.

# Inputs:
- project-requirements
- architecture-decision-records
- technology-stack-choice

# Outputs:
- application-architecture
- integration-plan
- deployment-manifest
- api-specification

# Constraints:
- Must remain technology-agnostic in orchestration
- Delegates technology-specific implementation to specialized skills
- Ensures proper integration between frontend, backend, and database layers
- Validates architectural patterns and best practices

# Examples:
- Orchestrate development of e-commerce platform (user chooses React + FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
- Guide microservices architecture implementation (user chooses Next.js + Express + MongoDB)
- Coordinate full-stack refactoring from monolith to microservices
