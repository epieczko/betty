description: Create comprehensive testing artifacts including test plans, test cases,
  test results, test automation strategies, and quality assurance reports. Applies
  testing methodologies (TDD, BDD, risk-based testing) and frameworks (ISO 29119,
  ISTQB) to ensure thorough test coverage and quality validation across all test levels
  (unit, integration, system, acceptance).
