name: security.architect
version: 0.1.0
description: Create comprehensive security architecture and assessment artifacts including
  threat models, security architecture diagrams, penetration testing reports, vulnerability
  management plans, and incident response plans. Applies security frameworks (STRIDE,
  NIST, ISO 27001, OWASP) and creates artifacts ready for security review and compliance
  audit.
status: draft
