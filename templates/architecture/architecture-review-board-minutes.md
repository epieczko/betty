## Best Practices

**Pre-Meeting Preparation**: Distribute proposal materials 48-72 hours before meeting; require submitters to complete standardized proposal template with architecture diagrams, quality attribute scenarios, and compliance mapping

**Quorum Verification**: Start each meeting with roll call and quorum verification per ARB charter; document voting vs. non-voting attendees; postpone decisions if quorum not met

**Standardized Template**: Use consistent minutes template with sections: attendees, quorum status, proposals reviewed, discussions, decisions, action items, appeals; enable easy scanning and comparison

**Real-Time Documentation**: Assign dedicated scribe (rotating role) to document minutes during meeting; use collaborative tools (Confluence, Google Docs) for simultaneous editing and review

**Decision Recording**: Capture exact voting counts (e.g., "Approved 6-1-2: 6 for, 1 against, 2 abstentions"); document dissenting opinions and concerns for transparency
