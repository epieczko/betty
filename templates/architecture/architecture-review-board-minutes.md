## Item 2: PROP-2025-012 - Microservices Migration Strategy

### Proposal Summary

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Proposal ID** | PROP-2025-012 |
| **Submitter** | Tom Patterson, Senior Solutions Architect |
| **Submission Date** | 2025-01-05 |
| **Business Unit** | Customer Experience Platform |
| **Proposal Type** | Architecture Pattern Adoption |
| **Estimated Impact** | High - affects 12 services, 25 engineers over 18 months |

### Architectural Context

**Current State**: Monolithic Ruby on Rails application (CustomerHub) serving customer management, order processing, and billing workflows. Performance bottlenecks during peak traffic (Black Friday 2024: 45% error rate), deployment cycles take 6+ weeks, rollback requires full system downtime.

**Proposed Target State**: Decompose monolith into 6 microservices following Domain-Driven Design bounded contexts:
1. Customer Service (user profiles, authentication)
2. Order Service (order management, fulfillment workflow)
3. Payment Service (billing, payment processing, PCI DSS scoped)
4. Notification Service (email, SMS, push notifications)
5. Analytics Service (customer behavior tracking, segmentation)
6. Admin Service (backoffice operations, customer support tools)

**Architecture Patterns Proposed**:
- Service mesh: Istio for service-to-service communication, mTLS, observability
- API Gateway: Kong for external API management, rate limiting, authentication
- Event-driven communication: RabbitMQ for asynchronous inter-service messaging
- Database per service: PostgreSQL instances with separate schemas
- Migration pattern: Strangler Fig (incremental replacement over 18 months)

**Quality Attribute Targets**:
- Performance: p95 latency < 300ms (current: 2.5s), support 10K concurrent users
- Availability: 99.95% SLA (current: 99.5%)
- Scalability: Horizontal auto-scaling per service, support 3x traffic growth
- Deployability: Independent service deployments, zero-downtime updates
- Maintainability: Service ownership by feature teams, isolated testing environments

### Discussion Highlights

**Technical Review**:
- Lisa Thompson: "Istio choice is aligned with organizational service mesh strategy. Recommend starting with Kong API Gateway pilot before full commitment."
- Alex Kumar: "Database-per-service pattern will require careful transaction management. Propose Saga pattern for distributed transactions across Order and Payment services."
- David Martinez: "Strangler Fig timeline is realistic. Recommend phased migration: Customer Service (Q2), Order Service (Q3), Payment Service (Q4) due to PCI DSS complexity."

**Security Concerns**:
- Emily Rodriguez: "Payment Service isolation is critical for PCI DSS scope reduction. Require separate VPC, dedicated encryption keys from AWS KMS, and quarterly penetration testing. mTLS with Istio is mandatory for inter-service communication."

**Data & Integration**:
- James Wilson: "Change Data Capture (CDC) from monolith to new services during migration phase is essential. Recommend Debezium for PostgreSQL CDC to RabbitMQ. Plan for data migration validation and reconciliation."

**Operational Readiness**:
- Sarah Johnson: "Six microservices increase operational complexity 6x. Require comprehensive observability (Datadog APM), runbooks for each service, on-call rotation trained on distributed troubleshooting before production."

**Risk Assessment**:
- Michael Chen: "Major risks: data consistency during migration, team skill gaps in microservices patterns, increased infrastructure cost (estimated 40% increase). Mitigation: hire senior microservices architect, invest in training, implement FinOps cost monitoring."

## Item 3: PROP-2025-013 - Multi-Region Active-Active Architecture

### Proposal Summary

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Proposal ID** | PROP-2025-013 |
| **Submitter** | Lisa Thompson, Principal Architect - Cloud |
| **Submission Date** | 2025-01-08 |
| **Business Unit** | Platform Engineering |
| **Proposal Type** | Disaster Recovery & High Availability |
| **Estimated Impact** | Critical - affects all Tier 1 services, $2M infrastructure investment |

### Architectural Context

**Current State**: Single-region deployment (us-east-1) with disaster recovery to us-west-2 (RTO: 4 hours, RPO: 15 minutes). Unacceptable downtime risk for global customer base, recent AWS region outage caused 6-hour outage and $3.5M revenue loss.

**Proposed Target State**: Active-active multi-region deployment across us-east-1 and eu-west-1 to support global user base (60% US, 30% EU, 10% APAC) with local latency and regional failover capability.

**Architecture Components**:
- Global load balancing: Route 53 with latency-based routing
- Regional deployments: Full application stack in each region (EKS, RDS, ElastiCache, S3)
- Data replication: PostgreSQL multi-region replication with conflict resolution
- Consistency model: Eventual consistency for non-critical data, strong consistency for financial transactions
- Cross-region communication: AWS PrivateLink for secure inter-region traffic
- Deployment strategy: Blue-green deployment per region, staggered rollouts

**Quality Attribute Targets**:
- Availability: 99.99% (43.2 min/year downtime, up from 99.9%)
- Latency: <100ms for 95% of global users (current: 250ms for EU users)
- RTO: <5 minutes (current: 4 hours)
- RPO: <1 minute (current: 15 minutes)
- Regional failover: Automatic within 60 seconds

### Discussion Highlights

**Data Consistency**:
- James Wilson: "Multi-region writes introduce consistency complexity. Recommend CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for user profiles, strong consistency with distributed transactions (Spanner or CockroachDB) for financial data."
- Lisa Thompson: "Propose tiered approach: eventual consistency for catalog/content data, strong consistency for orders/payments. Use AWS Aurora Global Database with 1-second RPO."

**Cost Analysis**:
- Sarah Johnson: "2x infrastructure cost in steady state (~$2M/year increase), plus data transfer costs ($150K/year). ROI justified by preventing outages (one 6-hour outage = $3.5M revenue loss + brand damage)."

**Compliance**:
- Emily Rodriguez: "EU data residency for GDPR compliance requires all EU customer data to remain in eu-west-1. Implement data partitioning by customer geography, route EU traffic exclusively to EU region."

**Operational Complexity**:
- David Martinez: "Active-active requires sophisticated traffic management, monitoring across regions, coordinated deployments. Recommend Region Evacuation Playbook for planned regional failover, Chaos Engineering to validate automatic failover."

### Decision

**APPROVED**

**Voting Record**:
- For: 6 (Unanimous)
- Against: 0
- Abstain: 0

**Approval Conditions**:

1. **Data Strategy Refinement** (Owner: James Wilson, Due: 2025-02-28):
   - Document consistency model for each data type
   - Implement Aurora Global Database for transactional data
   - Design conflict resolution strategy with business stakeholder input
   - Validate data partitioning for GDPR compliance

2. **Operational Readiness** (Owner: Lisa Thompson, Due: 2025-03-30):
   - Develop region evacuation runbooks

## Item 4: PROP-2025-014 - API Gateway Modernization

### Proposal Summary

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Proposal ID** | PROP-2025-014 |
| **Submitter** | David Martinez, Principal Architect - Platform |
| **Submission Date** | 2025-01-10 |
| **Business Unit** | Platform Engineering |
| **Proposal Type** | Technology Modernization |
| **Estimated Impact** | Medium - affects external API consumers, 6-month migration |

### Architectural Context

**Current State**: Legacy Apigee API gateway (end-of-support 2026) managing 150+ API endpoints, lacks modern features (GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket), complex configuration with Java policies, high operational cost ($250K/year).

**Proposed Target State**: Migrate to Kong Gateway (open-source with enterprise features) for modern API management with support for REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and WebSocket protocols.

**Migration Strategy**: Parallel run of Apigee and Kong for 3 months, gradual traffic shift (10% → 50% → 100%), rollback capability at each stage.

### Discussion Highlights

**Security Concerns**:
- Emily Rodriguez: "Kong requires additional security hardening. Need comprehensive security assessment including OAuth 2.0 flows, rate limiting bypass testing, API key rotation procedures. Current proposal lacks detail on secrets management for API keys and certificates."

**Operational Complexity**:
- Sarah Johnson: "Team has deep Apigee expertise but limited Kong experience. Training costs and learning curve during migration are underestimated. Recommend Kong professional services engagement for first 6 months."

**API Consumer Impact**:
- Michael Chen: "150+ API consumers (partners, mobile apps, web apps) need communication plan, migration timeline, backward compatibility guarantees. Proposal doesn't address API versioning strategy or deprecation policy for legacy endpoints."

### Decision

**DEFERRED TO NEXT MEETING (ARB-2025-018 on 2025-02-12)**

**Deferral Reason**: Insufficient security detail and API consumer migration plan. Proposal requires additional work before approval.

**Required Improvements**:

1. **Security Assessment** (Owner: Emily Rodriguez & David Martinez):
   - Conduct Kong security assessment covering OWASP API Security Top 10
   - Document secrets management for API keys, JWT tokens, TLS certificates
   - Define rate limiting and DDoS protection strategy
   - Plan for API security testing (penetration test, DAST scanning)

2. **API Consumer Migration Plan** (Owner: David Martinez):
   - Identify all API consumers with contact information
   - Develop communication plan with 90-day notice
   - Define backward compatibility requirements
   - Create API deprecation policy with sunset timelines
   - Plan for consumer testing and validation

3. **Operational Readiness** (Owner: David Martinez):
   - Quantify training needs and budget ($50K estimate)
   - Engage Kong professional services for implementation support
   - Develop Kong runbooks and troubleshooting guides
   - Plan for 24/7 on-call coverage during migration

4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis** (Owner: Sarah Johnson):
   - Detailed TCO comparison: Apigee vs. Kong (licensing, support, operations)
   - Migration cost breakdown (engineering time, professional services, training)
   - ROI calculation with 3-year projection
