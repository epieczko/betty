# Use Case Diagrams
# See also: artifact_descriptions/use-case-diagrams.md for complete guidance

# Use Case Diagrams are UML 2.5 visual models that depict system functionality from an external user perspective, showing actors (users, external systems), use cases (system capabilities), system bounda

# PURPOSE
# This artifact serves as a visual representation of system functionality showing actors, use cases, system boundary, and relationships using standardized UML 2.5 notation. It supports requirements elicitation by providing a high-level view of what the system does, who uses it, and how use cases relat...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - UML 2.5 Compliance: Follow standard UML notation (stick figures for actors, ovals for use cases, rectangles for system b
# - User-Goal Orientation: Name use cases as user goals (verb-noun format like "Process Payment" not "Payment Processing")
# - Appropriate Granularity: Keep diagrams at appropriate abstraction level; avoid overly detailed or overly abstract use cases
# - Actor Identification: Identify all primary actors (initiate use cases), secondary actors (support), and external systems
# - System Boundary: Clearly delineate system boundary; place use cases inside, actors outside the boundary
