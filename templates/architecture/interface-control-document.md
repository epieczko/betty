## Executive Summary

The Interface Control Document (ICD) is a comprehensive technical specification that defines the contract, protocols, message formats, data models, and integration requirements between two or more systems, services, or components. This artifact serves as the authoritative reference for API contracts

## Purpose

This document establishes the complete technical specification for integration interfaces between systems, defining the contract that both provider and consumer must adhere to for successful integration. It solves the coordination problem in distributed systems by documenting protocols, message formats, data semantics, error conditions, and operational commitments, enabling teams to develop and te

## Scope

### In Scope

- Interface protocols
- API specifications
- Request/response formats
- Data models
- Authentication & authorization

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered

## Main Content

<!-- Provide detailed content specific to this artifact type -->
<!-- Refer to the artifact description for required sections -->

## Best Practices

**Contract-First Development**: Create and agree on ICD before implementation begins to enable parallel development

**Complete API Specifications**: Provide full OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/Protobuf schemas with all endpoints, operations, and data models

**Comprehensive Examples**: Include request/response examples for all operations including success and error scenarios

**Explicit Error Catalog**: Document all possible error conditions with codes, messages, and recommended consumer actions

**Clear Data Semantics**: Define precise meaning, constraints, and business rules for every field in payloads

**Authentication Details**: Specify complete OAuth flows, token formats, required scopes, or API key mechanisms

**Concrete SLA Metrics**: Define measurable targets (99.9% availability, <200ms p95 latency, 1000 req/sec throughput)

**Environment-Specific Endpoints**: Document URLs, ports, and connection details for all environments
