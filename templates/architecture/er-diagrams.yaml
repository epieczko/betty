# PURPOSE
# This artifact provides visual representation of entity-relationship models using standardized notation systems. It depicts entities, attributes, primary/foreign keys, relationships, cardinality, and constraints in a format that enables database design, communication with stakeholders, normalization 

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Notation Consistency: - **Single Notation**: Use one consistent notation throughout (Crow's Foot recommended for clarity)
# - Entity Design: - **Meaningful Names**: Use clear, business-meaningful entity names (Customer, not CUST_TBL)
# - Relationship Modeling: - **Resolve Many-to-Many**: Always resolve M:N relationships with associative entities
# - Attribute Management: - **Atomic Attributes**: Ensure all attributes are atomic (1NF); break composite attributes into com
# - Normalization: - **Start Normalized**: Begin with fully normalized model (3NF/BCNF)

# Main content - customize based on artifact type
