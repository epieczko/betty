# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Version Control: Store diagrams in Git alongside infrastructure-as-code, use semantic versioning, maintain diagram so
# - Multiple View Levels: Create high-level overview for executives, detailed technical diagrams for engineers, security-focus
# - Consistent Iconography: Use official cloud provider icons (AWS Architecture Icons, Azure Icons, GCP Icons) for consistency
# - Color Coding: Use consistent color scheme for trust zones (red=public DMZ, yellow=private app, green=data tier, bl
# - Layered Approach: Separate logical (VPC, subnets, routing) from physical (regions, AZs) to avoid cluttering single dia
