# PURPOSE
# This artifact visually documents network architecture to communicate infrastructure design decisions, support security assessments and threat modeling, demonstrate compliance with network segmentation requirements (PCI DSS, HIPAA, Zero Trust), enable rapid incident response by providing clear data f

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Version Control: Store diagrams in Git alongside infrastructure-as-code, use semantic versioning, maintain diagram so
# - Multiple View Levels: Create high-level overview for executives, detailed technical diagrams for engineers, security-focus
# - Consistent Iconography: Use official cloud provider icons (AWS Architecture Icons, Azure Icons, GCP Icons) for consistency
# - Color Coding: Use consistent color scheme for trust zones (red=public DMZ, yellow=private app, green=data tier, bl
# - Layered Approach: Separate logical (VPC, subnets, routing) from physical (regions, AZs) to avoid cluttering single dia
