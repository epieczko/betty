# PURPOSE
# This artifact provides visual architecture diagrams of data pipelines, CI/CD pipelines, or workflow orchestration systems using standard notation (C4 Model, UML, ArchiMate) or diagramming tools (Lucidchart, draw.io, Mermaid, PlantUML, Diagrams-as-Code). It communicates system architecture, data flow...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Layered Diagrams: Create multiple levels of detail (C4 Model: Context, Container, Component, Code), start with high-le
# - Standard Notation: Use consistent symbols and notation (AWS icons, Azure icons, Kubernetes icons, data flow arrows, gro
# - Diagrams as Code: Use Mermaid, PlantUML, Python Diagrams, or Terraform Graph for version-controlled, maintainable diag
# - Clear Data Flow: Show direction of data movement with arrows, label data formats and volumes, indicate batch vs. stre
# - Technology Labeling: Clearly identify all technologies used (Airflow 2.x, Snowflake, dbt 1.x, Kubernetes 1.28), include v
