## Best Practices

**Business Alignment**: Ground vision in business strategy and objectives; map technical capabilities to business capabilities; demonstrate ROI and business value of transformation

**Stakeholder Engagement**: Conduct architecture workshops with business, product, and technology leaders; build consensus on priorities; address concerns and constraints early

**Current State Honesty**: Conduct thorough current state assessment including technical debt, security vulnerabilities, scalability limitations; avoid sugar-coating challenges

**Measurable Targets**: Define specific, measurable quality attribute targets using ISO 25010 and SEI scenarios; avoid vague aspirations like "improve performance"

**Phased Approach**: Break transformation into manageable phases (typically 3-5 phases over 2-4 years); define clear milestones and success criteria for each phase
