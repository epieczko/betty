## Executive Summary

This Architecture Vision defines our strategic transformation from a monolithic, on-premise architecture to a modern, cloud-native, microservices-based platform over a 3-year horizon (2025-2027). The transformation addresses critical business drivers: global market expansion requiring sub-100ms latency worldwide, 10x traffic growth projection, and need for weekly feature releases (vs. current quarterly cycle).

**Strategic Outcomes**:
- **Performance**: p95 latency <200ms globally (current: 1.2s), support 50M+ monthly active users (current: 5M)
- **Availability**: 99.99% SLA (current: 99.5%), <5min RTO for regional failures (current: 4hr RTO)
- **Velocity**: Weekly deployments with zero-downtime (current: quarterly with 4hr maintenance windows)
- **Cost Efficiency**: 35% infrastructure cost reduction through cloud optimization and autoscaling
- **Security**: Zero Trust architecture with mTLS, encryption everywhere, SOC 2 Type II + ISO 27001 compliance

**Investment**: $12M over 3 years ($4M/year) with expected ROI of 240% through revenue enablement, operational efficiency, and cost savings.

**Timeline**: 3-year phased transformation aligned to business roadmap and risk mitigation strategy.

## Business Context & Drivers

### Strategic Business Objectives (2025-2027)

| Objective | Target | Timeline | Architecture Dependency |
|-----------|--------|----------|------------------------|
| Global expansion to APAC & LATAM markets | 15 new countries | 2025-2026 | Multi-region active-active, <100ms latency |
| 10x user growth | 5M → 50M MAU | 2025-2027 | Horizontal scalability, auto-scaling, cost optimization |
| Real-time personalization | 80% of users | 2026-Q2 | Event streaming, ML/AI platform, low-latency data access |
| Mobile-first experience | 70% mobile traffic | 2025-Q4 | API-first, offline support, edge caching |
| Marketplace ecosystem | 500+ third-party apps | 2027-Q1 | Developer platform, API management, multi-tenancy |

### Business Pain Points Driving Transformation

**Customer Experience**:
- **Latency**: International users experience 800ms-2s page load times (target: <200ms p95)
- **Availability**: Monthly outages averaging 4 hours impact 99.5% SLA (target: 99.99%)
- **Mobile Performance**: Mobile app crashes at 3.5% rate (industry standard: <1%)

**Business Agility**:
- **Time to Market**: Quarterly releases prevent rapid feature iteration (target: weekly deployments)
- **A/B Testing**: Limited experimentation capability restricts product optimization
- **Market Responsiveness**: Cannot quickly adapt to market changes or competitor innovations

**Operational Efficiency**:
- **Infrastructure Costs**: Over-provisioned on-premise datacenter at $8M/year with 40% idle capacity
- **Operational Overhead**: 15 engineers managing infrastructure (target: 5 SREs with automation)
- **Technical Debt**: Estimated 18 months of accumulated debt slowing development velocity by 40%

**Security & Compliance**:
- **Audit Compliance**: SOC 2 gaps require significant manual controls and documentation
- **Data Residency**: Cannot meet GDPR data residency without multi-region deployment
- **Zero Trust**: Perimeter security model incompatible with modern hybrid/remote workforce

## Migration Strategy

### Strangler Fig Pattern

Incremental replacement of monolith functionality following Martin Fowler's Strangler Fig pattern:

```
Migration Approach:

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│               API Gateway (Routing Layer)                │
│    Routes traffic to monolith OR microservice            │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                ↓                           ↓
        ┌───────────────┐          ┌───────────────────┐
        │   Monolith    │          │  Microservices    │
        │  (Shrinking)  │          │   (Growing)       │
        └───────────────┘          └───────────────────┘
                ↓                           ↓
        ┌───────────────┐          ┌───────────────────┐
        │  Oracle DB    │  ←─CDC─→ │  PostgreSQL DBs   │
        │ (Read-only)   │          │  (Primary Write)  │
        └───────────────┘          └───────────────────┘

Phase 1: Route 10% traffic to User Service (microservice)
Phase 2: Route 50% traffic after validation
Phase 3: Route 100% traffic, monolith retired
```

## Architecture Principles

Following TOGAF architecture principles framework:

### Business Principles

1. **Business Continuity**: Architecture must support 99.99% availability with <5min RTO
2. **Customer Experience First**: p95 latency <200ms globally, optimize for mobile
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR, PCI DSS, SOC 2, ISO 27001 compliance by design
4. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Real-time analytics and experimentation capabilities

### Data Principles

5. **Data is an Asset**: Treat data as strategic asset with proper governance and quality
6. **Single Source of Truth**: Each data domain has authoritative source service
7. **Privacy by Design**: PII minimization, encryption, data residency compliance
8. **Data Portability**: Standard formats, avoid vendor lock-in, export capabilities

### Application Principles

9. **API-First**: All functionality exposed via well-documented, versioned APIs
10. **Service Autonomy**: Microservices own data, deployable independently
11. **Resilience by Design**: Circuit breakers, retries, graceful degradation, chaos engineering
12. **Observability Built-In**: Structured logging, distributed tracing, metrics for all services

### Technology Principles

## Quality Attributes & Targets

Using ISO 25010 quality model with measurable SEI quality attribute scenarios:

### Performance Efficiency

| Scenario | Stimulus | Response | Measure (Current → Target) |
|----------|----------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Page Load** | User requests homepage from US | Page fully rendered | p95: 1.2s → 200ms |
| **API Response** | Mobile app calls order API | Order details returned | p95: 800ms → 150ms |
| **Search Latency** | User searches for "shoes" | Results displayed | p95: 1.5s → 100ms |
| **Throughput** | Black Friday peak traffic | System processes requests | 5K RPS → 50K RPS |

**Tactics**: Horizontal auto-scaling, Redis caching, CDN, database read replicas, Elasticsearch

### Reliability

| Scenario | Stimulus | Response | Measure (Current → Target) |
|----------|----------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Uptime** | Normal operations | System available | 99.5% → 99.99% (43.2 min/year) |
| **Regional Failure** | AWS region outage | Automatic failover to healthy region | RTO: 4 hours → 5 minutes |
| **Data Durability** | Disaster scenario | Data recoverable | RPO: 15 min → 1 minute |
| **Service Failure** | Microservice crashes | Graceful degradation, no cascading failure | 0 data loss, degraded mode |

**Tactics**: Multi-region active-active, Aurora Global Database, circuit breakers, health checks

## Investment & ROI

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

**Current State (On-Premise)**:
- Infrastructure: $8M/year (datacenter, servers, network, storage)
- Licensing: $2M/year (Oracle, F5, monitoring tools)
- Personnel: $3M/year (15 infrastructure engineers, 10 developers)
- **Total**: $13M/year

**Target State (Cloud-Native AWS)**:
- AWS Infrastructure: $5M/year (compute, storage, network, managed services)
- Licensing: $800K/year (Datadog, Auth0, Kong enterprise, minor tools)
- Personnel: $2M/year (5 SREs, 15 developers with higher productivity)
- **Total**: $7.8M/year

**Annual Savings**: $5.2M/year (40% reduction)

### ROI Calculation

**Revenue Impact**:
- Market expansion enabled: $15M additional revenue/year (APAC + LATAM markets)
- Reduced cart abandonment (faster checkout): $3M/year
- Uptime improvement (fewer outages): $2M/year
- **Total Revenue Impact**: $20M/year

**Cost Savings**:
- Infrastructure cost reduction: $5.2M/year
- Operational efficiency: $1M/year (reduced manual operations)
- **Total Cost Savings**: $6.2M/year

**Net Benefit**: $20M (revenue) + $6.2M (cost savings) = $26.2M/year

**ROI**: ($26.2M × 3 years - $12M initial investment) / $12M = **553% over 3 years**
