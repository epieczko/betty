# PURPOSE
# This artifact serves as the architectural blueprint for implementing Zero Trust security principles across networks, applications, and data. It defines how to eliminate implicit trust, enforce continuous verification, implement micro-segmentation, and establish defense-in-depth controls that protect

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Version Control: Store in centralized version control system (Git, SharePoint with versioning, etc.) to maintain comp
# - Naming Conventions: Follow organization's document naming standards for consistency and discoverability
# - Template Usage: Use approved templates to ensure completeness and consistency across teams
# - Peer Review: Have at least one qualified peer review before submitting for approval
# - Metadata Completion: Fully complete all metadata fields to enable search, classification, and lifecycle management
