# PURPOSE
# Release certification formally validates that a software release has successfully completed all quality gates, security scans, performance tests, operational readiness checks, and obtained required stakeholder approvals before production deployment. It serves as the go/no-go decision artifact for IT

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Automated Quality Gates: Integrate certification checklist into CI/CD pipeline with automated pass/fail criteria
# - Test Evidence Links: Provide direct links to test reports, security scans, performance results, and monitoring dashboards
# - Objective Pass Criteria: Define measurable success criteria (e.g., 80% code coverage, zero critical vulnerabilities, p95 late
# - Smoke Test Validation: Execute comprehensive smoke test suite in production-like staging environment before certification
# - Performance Baseline: Establish and document performance baseline metrics before release for post-deployment comparison
