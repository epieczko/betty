# PURPOSE
# This artifact defines the Kustomize directory structure, kustomization.yaml files, bases, overlays, patches, and resource generators that compose environment-specific Kubernetes manifests. It enables teams to maintain a single source of truth for base configurations while applying targeted customiza

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Minimal Overlays: Keep overlays small - override only what differs from base, avoiding duplication
# - Base Reusability: Design bases to be reusable across multiple environments and teams
# - Semantic Versioning: Version remote bases using Git tags following semantic versioning
# - Hash Suffixes: Enable hash suffixes for ConfigMaps/Secrets to trigger rolling updates on changes
# - Strategic Merge First: Prefer strategic merge patches over JSON patches for better readability

# Main content - customize based on artifact type
