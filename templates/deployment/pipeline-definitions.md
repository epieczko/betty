## 1. Pipeline Architecture Patterns

### 1.1 Linear Pipeline (Simple)

```
Source → Build → Test → Deploy Dev → Deploy Staging → Deploy Production
```

**Best for**: Small teams, microservices, simple applications
**Pros**: Easy to understand, fast feedback
**Cons**: No parallelization, sequential bottlenecks

### 1.2 Fan-Out/Fan-In Pipeline (Parallel)

```
Source → Build → ┬─ Unit Tests
                 ├─ Integration Tests
                 ├─ E2E Tests
                 ├─ Security Scan
                 └─ Quality Gate → Package → Deploy
```

**Best for**: Large codebases, comprehensive testing
**Pros**: Parallel execution, faster pipelines
**Cons**: Resource intensive, complex orchestration

### 1.3 Multi-Stage Pipeline (Enterprise)

```
Source → ┬─ Build Backend → Test Backend → Security Scan → ┐
         ├─ Build Frontend → Test Frontend → UI Tests ───────┤
         └─ Build Mobile → Test Mobile → Mobile Tests ───────┴→ Integration → Deploy
```

**Best for**: Monorepos, multi-component systems
**Pros**: Independent builds, targeted testing
**Cons**: Complex dependencies, longer total time

---

## 2. Standard Pipeline Stages

### 2.1 Source Stage

**Purpose**: Retrieve source code and prepare workspace

```yaml
source:
  triggers:
    - push_to_branch
    - pull_request
    - scheduled_cron
    - manual_dispatch

  checkout:
    depth: full  # or shallow for speed
    submodules: true
    lfs: true

  workspace_preparation:
    - cache_dependencies
    - setup_build_tools
    - validate_branch_protection
```

### 2.2 Build Stage

**Purpose**: Compile code, resolve dependencies, create artifacts

```yaml
build:
  pre_build:
    - dependency_resolution
    - cache_restoration

  compilation:
    - transpile_typescript
    - bundle_assets
    - minify_code
    - generate_source_maps

  post_build:
    - cache_dependencies
    - upload_artifacts
    - generate_build_metadata

  duration_target: 5_minutes
  cache_strategy: incremental
```

### 2.3 Test Stage

**Purpose**: Validate functionality, quality, performance

```yaml
test:
  unit_tests:
    coverage_threshold: 80%
    fail_on_threshold: true
    parallel: true

  integration_tests:
    database: ephemeral_postgres
    cache: redis
    message_queue: rabbitmq

  e2e_tests:
    browser: chromium
    viewport: [1920x1080, 414x896]
    parallel_workers: 4

  performance_tests:
    load_profile: staging_like
    duration: 10m
    assertions:
      - p95_latency < 200ms
      - error_rate < 1%
```

### 2.4 Security Stage

**Purpose**: Identify vulnerabilities, secrets, compliance issues

```yaml
security:
  sast:  # Static Application Security Testing
    tool: semgrep
    ruleset: [OWASP-Top-10, security-audit]
    fail_on: [critical, high]

  sca:  # Software Composition Analysis
    tool: snyk
    check_dependencies: true
    check_containers: true
    license_compliance: true

  secrets_scanning:
    tool: trufflehog
    scan_history: true
    fail_on_detection: true

  container_scanning:
    tool: trivy
    severity_threshold: HIGH
    scan_layers: true
```

### 2.5 Package Stage

**Purpose**: Create deployable artifacts

```yaml
package:
  docker:
    multi_stage_build: true
    base_image: alpine:3.19
    platforms: [linux/amd64, linux/arm64]
    signing: cosign
    sbom_generation: true

  versioning:
    strategy: semver
    format: "{major}.{minor}.{patch}+{build}"
    tag_latest: on_main_branch

  artifact_registry:
    type: container_registry
    url: ghcr.io
    retention_policy:
      keep_tagged: 30_days
      keep_untagged: 7_days
```

### 2.6 Deploy Stage

**Purpose**: Release to environments

```yaml
deploy:
  strategy: progressive_delivery

  development:
    trigger: automatic
    approval: none
    rollback: automatic

  staging:
    trigger: automatic
    approval: team_lead
    smoke_tests: required
    rollback: automatic

  production:
    trigger: manual
    approval: [platform_team, security_team]
    strategy: canary
    canary_steps: [10%, 25%, 50%, 100%]
    monitoring_duration: 30m
    rollback: automatic_on_error
```

## 3. Deployment Strategies

### 3.1 Rolling Deployment

```yaml
rolling:
  description: Gradually replace old version with new version

  configuration:
    max_surge: 1  # Extra pods during rollout
    max_unavailable: 0  # Zero-downtime

  use_cases:
    - Development environment
    - Non-critical services
    - Small-scale deployments

  pros:
    - Simple configuration
    - Gradual rollout
    - Built-in Kubernetes support

  cons:
    - Mixed versions during rollout
    - Slow rollback
    - No traffic control
```

### 3.2 Blue-Green Deployment

```yaml
blue_green:
  description: Two identical environments, switch traffic instantly

  workflow:
    1. Deploy new version to green (inactive)
    2. Run smoke tests on green
    3. Switch traffic from blue to green
    4. Monitor green environment
    5. Keep blue as instant rollback
    6. Decommission blue after stabilization

  use_cases:
    - Database schema changes
    - Major version upgrades
    - Instant rollback requirement

  pros:
    - Instant cutover
    - Instant rollback
    - No mixed versions
    - Production testing before cutover

  cons:
    - Double infrastructure cost
    - Database synchronization complexity
    - Stateful services challenges
```

### 3.3 Canary Deployment

```yaml
canary:
  description: Gradual traffic shift with monitoring

  stages:
    - traffic: 10%
      duration: 15m
      metrics: [error_rate, latency, cpu]
      rollback_threshold:
        error_rate: "> 1%"
        latency_p95: "> 500ms"

    - traffic: 25%
      duration: 30m
      metrics: [error_rate, latency, memory]

    - traffic: 50%
      duration: 1h
      metrics: [error_rate, latency, saturation]

    - traffic: 100%
      duration: 0

  use_cases:
    - High-risk changes
    - New feature rollouts
    - Production A/B testing

  pros:
    - Risk mitigation
    - Real user feedback
    - Gradual validation

  cons:
    - Complex setup
    - Longer deployment time
    - Requires monitoring integration
```

### 3.4 Feature Flag Deployment

```yaml
feature_flags:
  description: Deploy code dark, enable features progressively

  workflow:
    1. Deploy to production with flag OFF
    2. Enable for internal users (1%)
    3. Enable for beta users (5%)
    4. Gradual rollout (10% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
    5. Remove flag after stabilization

  use_cases:
    - Decoupling deploy from release
    - A/B testing
    - Instant rollback without redeploy
    - Gradual feature rollouts

  pros:
    - Instant enable/disable
    - No redeployment for rollback
    - Targeted rollouts
    - Kill switch capability

  cons:
    - Code complexity
    - Flag debt accumulation
    - Runtime performance overhead
```

## 5. Pipeline Best Practices

### 5.1 Speed Optimization

1. **Parallel Execution**: Run independent jobs concurrently
2. **Caching**: Cache dependencies, build artifacts, Docker layers
3. **Incremental Builds**: Only rebuild changed components
4. **Fast Failure**: Fail fast on critical errors
5. **Test Optimization**: Run fast tests first, parallelize slow tests

### 5.2 Security Best Practices

1. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for pipeline runners
2. **Secret Management**: Use vault/secret managers, never commit secrets
3. **Immutable Artifacts**: Build once, deploy many
4. **Signed Artifacts**: Sign containers with Cosign/Notary
5. **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials for all artifacts

### 5.3 Reliability Best Practices

1. **Idempotent Pipelines**: Re-running produces same result
2. **Automated Rollback**: Automatic rollback on failure
3. **Health Checks**: Comprehensive liveness/readiness probes
4. **Deployment Windows**: Controlled deployment times
5. **Change Freeze**: Blackout periods (holidays, peak seasons)

## 6. Monitoring & Observability

### 6.1 Pipeline Metrics

```yaml
metrics:
  dora_metrics:
    deployment_frequency:
      target: multiple_per_day
      current: 15_per_week

    lead_time_for_changes:
      target: < 1_hour
      current: 2_hours

    change_failure_rate:
      target: < 15%
      current: 8%

    mttr:  # Mean Time To Recovery
      target: < 1_hour
      current: 45_minutes

  pipeline_health:
    success_rate: > 95%
    build_duration: < 15_minutes
    test_pass_rate: > 98%
    deployment_success: > 99%
```

### 6.2 Alerting

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: Pipeline Failure Rate High
    condition: failure_rate > 10%
    window: 1h
    severity: warning
    channels: [slack-deployments]

  - name: Production Deployment Failed
    condition: production_deploy_status == failed
    severity: critical
    channels: [pagerduty, slack-incidents]

  - name: Build Duration Increased
    condition: build_duration > 20m
    window: 3_builds
    severity: info
    channels: [slack-platform]
```
