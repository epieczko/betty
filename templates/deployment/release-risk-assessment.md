## Pre-Mortem Analysis

### Scenario 1: "The Midnight Meltdown"

**Situation**: At 03:30 UTC (90 minutes into rollout at 10% traffic), payment success rate drops to 94%. On-call engineer investigates and finds Stripe API returning "invalid_request_error" for all Payment Intents with saved payment methods. Root cause: API parameter `payment_method` requires different format when using saved cards vs. new cards.

**Impact**:
- 6% of payment attempts failing = ~180 failed transactions
- $7,200 estimated revenue loss during 45-minute incident
- 12 customer support tickets filed

**Prevention**:
- ✅ Add integration tests specifically for saved payment methods (currently missing)
- ✅ Enhanced monitoring: Alert immediately on any "invalid_request_error" pattern
- ⏳ Manual smoke test checklist: Test 1 new card + 1 saved card before rollout (creating)

**Owner**: Sarah Chen
**Action Items**: Add saved payment method tests by 2024-01-18

---

### Scenario 2: "The European Blockade"

**Situation**: EU checkout conversion rate drops 25% at 25% traffic rollout. Session replays reveal 3D Secure authentication modals are rendering but submit button is unclickable on Safari iOS due to CSS z-index issue with Stripe iframe.

**Impact**:
- 8.75% of total traffic affected (25% rollout × 35% EU market)
- $10,500/hour revenue loss
- Major merchant complaints from EU-focused businesses

**Prevention**:
- ✅ Dedicated iOS Safari testing added to pre-deployment checklist
- ✅ Visual regression tests for 3DS modal using Percy
- ✅ Canary rollout limited to 5% max until EU conversion validated
- ✅ Conversion rate monitoring with EU-specific alerts

**Owner**: Jennifer Wu
**Action Items**: Add Percy visual tests by 2024-01-17

---

### Scenario 3: "The Webhook Avalanche"

**Situation**: After 100% rollout, Black Friday sale begins. Webhook volume increases 10x (normal surge handled well). However, new `payment_intent.processing` events fire 3x per transaction due to Stripe API behavior, creating 30x webhook volume. Queue depth reaches 50,000 messages. Order confirmations delayed by 2+ hours.

**Impact**:
- No payment failures (good!)
- Severe customer experience issues: Late order confirmations, double-charging concerns
- 200+ support tickets, social media complaints

**Prevention**:
- ✅ Webhook deduplication logic using idempotency keys
- ⏳ Load testing with 30x webhook volume (currently tested at 10x)
- ✅ Queue depth auto-scaling increased from 20 to 50 max replicas
- ✅ Event filtering: Only process terminal states (succeeded/failed), ignore processing

**Owner**: Alex Martinez
**Action Items**: Complete 30x webhook load test by 2024-01-19

## Blast Radius Estimation

### User Impact

| Scenario | Users Affected | Percentage | Revenue Impact |
|----------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| Total failure (rollback needed) | 100% of checkout users | ~5,000 users/hour (peak) | $12,000/hour |
| EU-only 3DS issues | EU checkout users | ~1,750 users/hour | $4,200/hour |
| Webhook delays | All successful payments | ~4,500 orders/hour | $0 direct, CX impact |
| Database migration failure | All payment users | 100% | Complete outage (15-30 min) |

### System Impact

| System | Criticality | Dependency Type | Impact if Failed |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Payment Service | **CRITICAL** | Direct | Cannot process any payments |
| Stripe API | **CRITICAL** | External | Cannot process payments (outside our control) |
| PostgreSQL Database | **CRITICAL** | Direct | Application crashes, cannot start |
| Order Service | **HIGH** | Downstream | Payments succeed but orders not created |
| Notification Service | **MEDIUM** | Downstream | Customers don't receive confirmations |
| Analytics Pipeline | **LOW** | Downstream | Payment metrics temporarily unavailable |

### Financial Impact

| Scenario | Duration | Revenue Loss | Additional Costs | Total Impact |
|----------|----------|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| 15-minute outage | 15 min | $3,000 | $0 | $3,000 |
| 1-hour degradation (95% success) | 1 hour | $7,200 | Support overtime $500 | $7,700 |
| 4-hour rollback + replan | 4 hours | $48,000 | Engineering $2,000 | $50,000 |
| Full rollback + 1 week delay | 1 week | $0 (no loss) | Opportunity cost $15,000 | $15,000 |

## Rollback Strategy

### Automated Rollback Triggers

**Circuit Breaker Thresholds** (automatic rollback, no human approval needed):

1. **Payment Success Rate < 98.5%** (current baseline: 99.2%)
   - Measurement window: 5 minutes
   - Minimum sample size: 100 transactions
   - Action: Immediate feature flag disable

2. **Stripe API Error Rate > 2%**
   - Error types: 4xx, 5xx, timeout
   - Measurement window: 3 minutes
   - Action: Immediate feature flag disable

3. **Payment Processing P95 Latency > 5 seconds** (baseline: 1.2s)
   - Measurement window: 5 minutes
   - Action: Alert SRE + auto-rollback after 10 minutes if not resolved

4. **Application Error Rate > 1%** (baseline: 0.08%)
   - Scope: Payment service 5xx errors
   - Measurement window: 3 minutes
   - Action: Immediate rollback

### Manual Rollback Triggers

**Require human judgment** (SRE on-call + Release Manager approval):

1. **EU Conversion Rate Drop > 15%**
2. **More than 5 customer complaints in 30 minutes** (via support tickets, social media)
3. **Top-20 merchant reports payment issues** (any severity)
4. **Webhook queue depth > 5,000 for 10+ minutes**
5. **Any security concern** (data leak, compliance violation)

### Rollback Procedures

#### Level 1: Feature Flag Rollback (Preferred - <2 minutes)

```yaml
# Disable new Payment Intents API, revert to legacy Charges API
Feature Flag: stripe_payment_intents_enabled
Current State: percentage_based (gradual rollout)
Rollback Action: Set to 0% (instant disable)
Recovery Time: <2 minutes (automated)
Impact: Zero downtime, instant reversion to stable code path
```

**Execution**:
1. SRE runs: `launch-darkly-cli set --flag stripe_payment_intents_enabled --value false`
2. Monitor payment success rate recovery (expect return to baseline within 3 minutes)
3. Incident postmortem scheduled within 24 hours

---

#### Level 2: Kubernetes Deployment Rollback (<5 minutes)

```bash
# Revert to previous deployment version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/payment-service -n production

# Verify rollback
kubectl rollout status deployment/payment-service -n production
```

**When to use**: Feature flag rollback insufficient (e.g., database schema issue)

**Recovery Time**: 5 minutes
**Impact**: ~30 seconds of elevated error rate during pod restarts

---

#### Level 3: Database Rollback (15-30 minutes)

**When to use**: Database migration caused corruption or performance issues

**Procedure**:
1. Immediately stop traffic to payment service (circuit breaker)
2. Restore database from pre-migration backup (automated, 10 minutes)
3. Run rollback migration scripts (5 minutes)
4. Validate schema and data integrity (5 minutes)
5. Restart payment service pods
6. Gradually restore traffic (canary 1% → 100%)

**Recovery Time**: 15-30 minutes
**Impact**: Complete payment outage during rollback

## Deployment Strategy

### Recommended Approach: **Canary Deployment with Progressive Rollout**

**Rationale**: High risk score (RPN 168) and financial criticality require gradual exposure with multiple validation gates.

### Rollout Schedule

| Phase | Traffic % | Duration | Success Criteria | Rollback Trigger |
|-------|-----------|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **Phase 0: Pre-Flight** | 0% | 30 min | All health checks green | Any check fails |
| **Phase 1: Internal** | 0.1% (employees only) | 1 hour | 100% payment success, no errors | Any payment failure |
| **Phase 2: Canary** | 1% | 2 hours | Success rate ≥99.2%, p95 latency <2s | Circuit breaker |
| **Phase 3: Small** | 5% | 3 hours | No degradation in KPIs | Circuit breaker |
| **Phase 4: Medium** | 25% | 6 hours | EU conversion stable, webhook queue normal | Manual review |
| **Phase 5: Large** | 50% | 12 hours | All metrics stable, no merchant complaints | Manual review |
| **Phase 6: Full** | 100% | - | Monitor for 48 hours | Manual only |

**Total Rollout Duration**: 24-48 hours
**Monitoring Window Post-Rollout**: 7 days

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Acceptable Range | Alert Threshold |
|--------|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Payment Success Rate | 99.2% | ≥99.0% | <98.5% |
| P95 Payment Latency | 1.2s | <2.0s | >5.0s |
| EU Checkout Conversion | 3.8% | ≥3.2% | <3.0% |
| Webhook Processing Latency | 450ms | <1.0s | >5.0s |
| Application Error Rate | 0.08% | <0.15% | >1.0% |
| Customer Support Tickets | ~30/day payment-related | <50/day | >75/day |

### Monitoring & Observability

**Real-Time Dashboards**:
1. Payment Success Rate (by region, merchant tier, payment method)
2. Stripe API Performance (latency, error rate, by endpoint)
3. Checkout Conversion Funnel (with 3DS completion rate)
4. Webhook Processing (queue depth, latency, error rate)
5. Database Performance (query latency, connection pool, replication lag)

**Alerts Configured**:
- PagerDuty: Critical payment failures (immediate)
- Slack #payments-alerts: Warning-level degradations
- Email: Daily rollout summary to stakeholders

**On-Call Assignments**:
- Primary: David Kim (SRE)
- Secondary: Sarah Chen (Payments Tech Lead)
