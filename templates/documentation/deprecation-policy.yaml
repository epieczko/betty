# PURPOSE
# This policy establishes mandatory procedures for deprecating software components (APIs, features, libraries, services, infrastructure), defining timeline requirements, communication protocols, migration support obligations, and sunset execution criteria. It ensures deprecated items follow Semantic V

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Tiered Timeline Model: Use 6-month minimum for internal APIs, 12-month for public APIs, 24+ months for critical infrastruct
# - SemVer Compliance: Increment MAJOR version for breaking changes; use MINOR for deprecation warnings with continued supp
# - Sunset HTTP Header: Implement RFC 8594 Sunset header returning deprecation date in HTTP responses for automated detectio
# - Multi-Phase Rollout: (1) Deprecation announcement, (2) Warning phase with logs, (3) Error phase, (4) Removal phase
# - Usage Telemetry: Instrument deprecated endpoints/features to track adoption of replacements before final sunset
