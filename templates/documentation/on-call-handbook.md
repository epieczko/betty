## Executive Summary

The On-Call Handbook is a comprehensive operational guide that defines on-call rotation schedules, escalation policies, response procedures, and support expectations for SRE teams and operations engineers. This critical artifact ensures 24/7 service reliability by establishing clear accountability, 

## Purpose

This artifact serves as the authoritative reference for all on-call operations, defining rotation schedules, escalation policies, SLA response times, handoff procedures, and support expectations. It solves the problem of inconsistent incident response by standardizing how engineers engage with production alerts, conduct shift handoffs, and escalate complex incidents through appropriate support tie

## Scope

### In Scope

- On-call rotation schedules (primary, secondary, tertiary) across teams and time zones
- Escalation policies and paths (L1 → L2 → L3 → management → executive)
- SLA response time requirements by severity level (P0/SEV0
- Shift handoff procedures, handoff checklists, and knowledge transfer protocols
- Integration with alerting platforms (PagerDuty, Opsgenie, VictorOps, xMatters)

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered

## Best Practices

**Rotation Fairness**: Distribute on-call burden equitably across team members; use metrics to track rotation balance and alert fatigue

**Clear Escalation Paths**: Define explicit L1 → L2 → L3 → management escalation chains with specific trigger criteria for each level

**SLA-Based Response Times**: Enforce response time commitments based on incident severity (P0: 15min, P1: 1hr, P2: 4hrs, P3: next business day)

**Shift Handoff Rituals**: Conduct structured handoffs with written summaries of ongoing incidents, pending alerts, and system status

**Runbook Integration**: Link common alert types to specific troubleshooting runbooks and automated remediation playbooks

**Alert Quality**: Continuously refine alerting thresholds to reduce noise and false positives; target <5% false positive rate

**On-Call Compensation**: Provide fair compensation (on-call pay, comp time, bonus) to acknowledge off-hours availability

**Maximum Rotation Length**: Limit consecutive on-call days (typically 7 days max) to prevent burnout
