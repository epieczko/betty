## Best Practices

**Front-Load Value**: Start with the key word in button labels, form fields, and instructions; users scan left-to-right, so "Download report" > "Report download"

**Action-Oriented Buttons**: Use verbs for actions ("Save changes" not "Changes"), be specific ("Create account" not "Submit"), describe the outcome ("Start 14-day trial" not "Continue")

**Error Messages: 3 Parts**: (1) What went wrong, (2) Why it happened, (3) How to fix it; "Invalid email" fails; "Email format incorrect. Use format: name@domain.com" succeeds

**Avoid Placeholder Pitfalls**: Don't use placeholder text as labels (accessibility fail); use placeholders only for format examples ("MM/DD/YYYY"), never for required instructions

**Empty States Tell Stories**: Transform "No items" into opportunityâ€”explain why it's empty, what value filling it provides, and offer clear action: "No saved searches yet. Save your favorite searches for quick access."
