## Executive Summary

Microcopy Guides are the essential reference for interface copy—the small but mighty words that guide users through products: button labels, error messages, empty states, form field instructions, tooltips, success confirmations, and all the tiny text that makes digital experiences usable or frustrat

## Purpose

This artifact provides specific, actionable guidance for every interface copy moment, ensuring consistency in voice, clarity in instruction, and empathy in error handling across the entire product experience. It solves the copy inconsistency problem where different designers use different button labels for the same action or engineers write technical error messages that confuse users, supporting r

## Scope

### In Scope

- Error message templates (client-side validation, server errors, system failures)
- Empty state messaging (first-use empty, user-cleared empty, error-state empty, no-results empty)
- Success and confirmation messages

### Out of Scope

## Best Practices

**Front-Load Value**: Start with the key word in button labels, form fields, and instructions; users scan left-to-right, so "Download report" > "Report download"

**Action-Oriented Buttons**: Use verbs for actions ("Save changes" not "Changes"), be specific ("Create account" not "Submit"), describe the outcome ("Start 14-day trial" not "Continue")

**Error Messages: 3 Parts**: (1) What went wrong, (2) Why it happened, (3) How to fix it; "Invalid email" fails; "Email format incorrect. Use format: name@domain.com" succeeds

**Avoid Placeholder Pitfalls**: Don't use placeholder text as labels (accessibility fail); use placeholders only for format examples ("MM/DD/YYYY"), never for required instructions

**Empty States Tell Stories**: Transform "No items" into opportunity—explain why it's empty, what value filling it provides, and offer clear action: "No saved searches yet. Save your favorite searches for quick access."

**Conversational but Concise**: Write like you speak to a friend who's in a hurry; cut "please," "in order to," "you can"; test: would you say this out loud?

**Consistent Terminology**: Pick one term and stick with it—don't alternate between "delete/remove," "save/store," "settings/preferences"; build a terminology glossary

**Tone Modulation**: Adjust tone to moment—onboarding is welcoming, errors are empathetic, confirmations are reassuring, destructive actions are serious
