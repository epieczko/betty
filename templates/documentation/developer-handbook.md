## Executive Summary

The Developer Handbook serves as the definitive onboarding and reference guide for engineering teams, documenting development environment setup, coding standards, Git workflows, CI/CD pipelines, architecture decisions (ADRs), testing practices, and team processes. Built with documentation frameworks

## Purpose

The Developer Handbook serves as the single source of truth for engineering practices, accelerating developer onboarding, standardizing development workflows, and capturing institutional knowledge about architecture decisions, coding conventions, and team processes. It solves the problem of fragmented tribal knowledge by consolidating development standards, environment setup procedures, and best p

## Scope

### In Scope

- Development environment setup (IDE configuration, language runtimes, development tools, local database setup)
- Coding standards and style guides (language-specific conventions, naming conventions, code formatting, linting rules)
- Git workflow and branching strategy (GitFlow, trunk-based development, feature branches, commit message conventions)
- Pull request and code review process (PR templates, review checklists, approval workflows)
- CI/CD pipeline documentation (build processes, automated testing, deployment procedures, release workflows)

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered

## Best Practices

**Docs-as-Code Integration**: Store developer handbook in Git repository alongside application code (monorepo or docs repository), implement pull request workflow for documentation updates, run automated testing on documentation changes (link checking, linting, code example validation), and deploy automatically on merge to main branch

**Onboarding-First Structure**: Design table of contents to follow new developer onboarding journey (environment setup → codebase tour → first contribution → advanced topics), create "Getting Started in 30 Minutes" quick-start guide, provide setup automation scripts (bootstrap scripts, Docker Compose environments), and maintain troubleshooting section for common setup issues

**Code Example Standards**: Provide complete, runnable code examples that developers can copy-paste, test all code examples in CI/CD pipeline, include language-specific syntax highlighting, show both successful and error cases, add comments explaining non-obvious code, and maintain examples for all supported languages/frameworks

**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document significant technical decisions using ADR format (Context, Decision, Consequences), store ADRs with documentation in version control, create ADRs before implementing major changes, link ADRs to related code via comments, and maintain ADR index for discoverability

**Interactive Documentation**: Embed live code playgrounds (CodeSandbox, StackBlitz, JSFiddle), provide "Try it Now" API examples with authentication, include interactive diagrams using Mermaid or PlantUML, add copy-to-clipboard buttons for code snippets, and create video walkthroughs for complex procedures

**Version Synchronization**: Maintain documentation versions aligned with software releases, provide version selector in documentation UI, clearly mark deprecated APIs and migration paths, maintain "What's New" section for each release, and archive documentation for EOL versions with deprecation warnings

**Search Optimization**: Implement full-text search (Algolia DocSearch recommended), optimize content for common developer queries (error messages, API names, concepts), maintain comprehensive glossary, provide autocomplete suggestions, and analyze search analytics to identify documentation gaps

**Validation & Quality**: Run Vale linting against style guide on every commit, check for broken links in CI/CD, validate code examples compile and run, spell-check technical content with custom dictionaries, enforce Markdown formatting with markdownlint, and maintain minimum readability scores
