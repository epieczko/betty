## Best Practices

**Welcoming First-Time Contributors**: Create "good first issue" labels for beginner-friendly tasks, provide detailed mentorship on first PRs, celebrate first-time contributors with bot comments or recognition, offer office hours or pair programming for newcomers, maintain comprehensive setup documentation, and respond promptly and kindly to questions

**Clear Contribution Process**: Document step-by-step contribution workflow with examples, provide flowcharts or diagrams showing PR lifecycle, include troubleshooting for common setup issues, create video walkthroughs of contribution process, link to all required templates (PR, issue), and set clear expectations for response times

**Automated Quality Gates**: Implement pre-commit hooks for code formatting and linting, run automated tests on every PR, validate commit message format automatically, check license headers and attribution, scan for security vulnerabilities, enforce code coverage thresholds, and provide clear feedback when checks fail

**Maintainable PR Standards**: Request small, focused PRs (< 400 lines ideal), encourage draft PRs for early feedback, require linked issue for context, enforce descriptive PR titles and descriptions, mandate testing evidence (screenshots, test results), and provide PR templates with checklist

**Inclusive Community Culture**: Enforce code of conduct consistently, use inclusive language in all communications, provide multiple communication channels for different preferences, accommodate different time zones and languages, recognize diverse contribution types (code, docs, community support), and foster psychological safety for questions
