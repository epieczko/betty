# PURPOSE
# This artifact provides a machine-readable specification for asynchronous, event-driven, and message-based APIs. It documents channels (topics, queues), operations (publish, subscribe, send, receive), message schemas, protocol bindings, and server configurations, enabling contract-first API developme

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Specification Design: - **Contract-First**: Design AsyncAPI spec before implementing producers/consumers
# - Channel Design: - **Descriptive Names**: Use clear channel names (user.created, order.shipped)
# - Message Schema Design: - **JSON Schema**: Use JSON Schema for validation and documentation
# - Operations: - **Publish vs Subscribe**: Clearly distinguish publisher and subscriber operations
# - Protocol Bindings: - **Specify Bindings**: Include protocol-specific bindings (Kafka, AMQP, MQTT)

# Main content - customize based on artifact type
