## Executive Summary

Upgrade Guides provide comprehensive procedures for migrating from one software version to another, documenting breaking changes, migration paths, rollback procedures, and compatibility considerations. Following change management best practices and the Di√°taxis Framework's how-to format, upgrade doc

## Purpose

Upgrade Guides enable safe, successful version migrations by providing comprehensive procedures that minimize downtime, prevent data loss, and ensure compatibility. They solve the problem of risky, undocumented upgrades by providing tested migration paths, rollback procedures, breaking change documentation, and validation steps that reduce upgrade-related incidents and accelerate adoption of new v

## Scope

## Best Practices

**Comprehensive Pre-Upgrade Planning**: Create detailed pre-upgrade checklist (compatibility, dependencies, backups), document current system state and configuration, identify breaking changes and required code changes, estimate downtime and schedule maintenance window, test upgrade in staging environment first, prepare rollback plan before starting, communicate upgrade schedule to all stakeholders, and obtain necessary change approvals

**Breaking Changes Front-and-Center**: Document all breaking changes at the top of upgrade guide, categorize by impact severity (critical, high, medium, low), provide code migration examples for API changes, document configuration file format changes, identify deprecated features being removed, provide automated migration scripts when possible, and link to detailed migration guides for complex changes

**Version Path Documentation**: Clearly state which versions can upgrade directly, document required intermediate upgrade steps (e.g., must upgrade to v2.5 before v3.0), provide skip-upgrade guidance when supported, maintain compatibility matrix across all versions, document unsupported upgrade paths, include version detection commands, and provide downgrade procedures if supported

**Backup and Rollback First**: Mandate backup verification before upgrade starts, provide specific backup commands for databases and config, include backup validation procedures, document point-in-time recovery options, provide detailed rollback procedures for each upgrade step, test rollback in staging environment, set rollback decision criteria and timelines, and document data consistency checks after rollback

**Database Migration Excellence**: Provide schema migration scripts with version control, test migrations against production-sized datasets, include forward and backward migration scripts, document expected migration duration, provide progress monitoring commands, handle long-running migrations gracefully, include data validation queries, and provide rollback for each migration step

**Zero-Downtime Strategies**: Document blue-green deployment procedures, provide rolling update sequences for clusters, include load balancer configuration changes, document database migration with backward compatibility, provide feature flag strategies for gradual rollout, include canary deployment monitoring, and define rollback triggers during phased rollout

**Automated Testing Integration**: Provide pre-upgrade compatibility test scripts, include automated smoke tests for post-upgrade validation, document expected test results and success criteria, automate regression testing for critical functionality, include performance benchmark comparisons, provide health check automation, and integrate with CI/CD pipelines

**Clear Step-by-Step Procedures**: Number all upgrade steps sequentially, begin each step with action verb (Backup, Stop, Upgrade, Verify), include expected output after each command, provide verification commands between major steps, estimate time for each section, highlight points of no return, include progress indicators for long-running operations, and document safe stopping points
