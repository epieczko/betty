## Best Practices

**Comprehensive Pre-Upgrade Planning**: Create detailed pre-upgrade checklist (compatibility, dependencies, backups), document current system state and configuration, identify breaking changes and required code changes, estimate downtime and schedule maintenance window, test upgrade in staging environment first, prepare rollback plan before starting, communicate upgrade schedule to all stakeholders, and obtain necessary change approvals

**Breaking Changes Front-and-Center**: Document all breaking changes at the top of upgrade guide, categorize by impact severity (critical, high, medium, low), provide code migration examples for API changes, document configuration file format changes, identify deprecated features being removed, provide automated migration scripts when possible, and link to detailed migration guides for complex changes

**Version Path Documentation**: Clearly state which versions can upgrade directly, document required intermediate upgrade steps (e.g., must upgrade to v2.5 before v3.0), provide skip-upgrade guidance when supported, maintain compatibility matrix across all versions, document unsupported upgrade paths, include version detection commands, and provide downgrade procedures if supported

**Backup and Rollback First**: Mandate backup verification before upgrade starts, provide specific backup commands for databases and config, include backup validation procedures, document point-in-time recovery options, provide detailed rollback procedures for each upgrade step, test rollback in staging environment, set rollback decision criteria and timelines, and document data consistency checks after rollback

**Database Migration Excellence**: Provide schema migration scripts with version control, test migrations against production-sized datasets, include forward and backward migration scripts, document expected migration duration, provide progress monitoring commands, handle long-running migrations gracefully, include data validation queries, and provide rollback for each migration step
