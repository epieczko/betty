## Best Practices

**Opinionated but Escapable**: Provide strong defaults and recommendations while allowing justified deviations with architectural review

**One-Click Creation**: Enable complete service creation from template in under 5 minutes with all integrations pre-configured

**Production-Ready from Start**: Include monitoring, logging, error tracking, security scanning, and deployment automation in every template

**Living Examples**: Maintain reference implementations that actually run in production as proof-of-concept and testing grounds

**Developer Feedback Loops**: Survey developers quarterly on template usability and pain points; iterate based on real usage data
