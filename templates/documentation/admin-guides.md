## Executive Summary

Admin Guides provide comprehensive system administration documentation for managing production systems, user accounts, security configurations, backup/recovery procedures, and monitoring infrastructure. Created using modern documentation platforms like Docusaurus, MkDocs, or GitBook, admin guides fo

## Purpose

Admin Guides serve as authoritative procedural documentation for system administrators to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot production systems. They solve the problem of inconsistent system administration practices by providing step-by-step procedures, configuration templates, and troubleshooting guides that reduce mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) and minimize configuration drift.

## Scope

### In Scope

- System administration procedures (user management, permissions, role-based access control)
- Configuration management (system settings, environment variables, service configuration)
- Backup and restore procedures (automated backups, disaster recovery, point-in-time recovery)
- Monitoring and alerting setup (metrics collection, dashboard configuration, alert thresholds)
- Security hardening procedures (CIS Benchmarks, security patches, vulnerability remediation)

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered

## Best Practices

**Docs-as-Code Implementation**: Store documentation source in Git repositories alongside infrastructure code, enable branch-based workflows with pull requests, automate builds and deployments through CI/CD pipelines, and version documentation in sync with system releases

**Task-Oriented Structure**: Organize admin guides by administrative tasks (user management, backup/restore, monitoring setup) rather than system components, following Di√°taxis how-to guide format with clear goal statements, prerequisites, step-by-step procedures, verification steps, and troubleshooting guidance

**Procedural Writing Standards**: Begin procedures with action verbs, use numbered lists for sequential steps, include expected outcomes after each step, provide command examples with actual syntax, explain parameters and options, include screenshots or terminal output examples, and add warnings/cautions before potentially destructive operations

**Configuration Examples**: Provide complete, working configuration file examples with inline comments explaining each setting, use syntax highlighting appropriate to file type, include environment-specific variations (dev, staging, production), and maintain example configurations as testable code

**Validation & Quality Assurance**: Implement automated testing of documentation with Vale for style consistency, markdownlint for Markdown formatting, spell checkers for typos, link checkers for broken references, and code snippet validators to ensure command examples remain current

**Search Optimization**: Structure content with descriptive headings, include searchable keywords and terminology, implement site search (Algolia DocSearch), create comprehensive navigation, provide breadcrumbs, maintain glossary of technical terms, and optimize for common troubleshooting queries

**Version Management**: Maintain documentation for all supported system versions, clearly label version-specific procedures, provide migration guides between versions, archive deprecated content with warnings, and implement version selector UI component

**Security-First Documentation**: Never include credentials or secrets in documentation examples, use placeholder values (e.g., YOUR_API_KEY), document least-privilege access patterns, include security hardening procedures, reference CIS Benchmarks and security frameworks, and maintain separate secure documentation for sensitive procedures
