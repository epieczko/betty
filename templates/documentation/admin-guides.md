## Executive Summary

<!-- Provide a 2-3 paragraph overview for executive audience -->
<!-- What is this document about and why does it matter? -->

## Purpose

<!-- Admin Guides serve as authoritative procedural documentation for system administrators to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot production systems. They solve the problem of inconsistent system admini... -->

## Scope

### In Scope

- System administration procedures (user management, permissions, role-based access control)
- Configuration management (system settings, environment variables, service configuration)
- Backup and restore procedures (automated backups, disaster recovery, point-in-time recovery)
- Monitoring and alerting setup (metrics collection, dashboard configuration, alert thresholds)
- Security hardening procedures (CIS Benchmarks, security patches, vulnerability remediation)

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered by this artifact

## Target Audience

### Primary Audience

- System Administrators who configure and maintain production systems
- DevOps Engineers who automate infrastructure and deployment pipelines
- Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) who ensure system availability and performance

### Secondary Audience

- Additional stakeholders who may reference this document

## Best Practices

**Docs-as-Code Implementation**: Store documentation source in Git repositories alongside infrastructure code, enable branch-based workflows with pull requests, automate builds and deployments through CI/CD pipelines, and version documentation in sync with system releases

**Task-Oriented Structure**: Organize admin guides by administrative tasks (user management, backup/restore, monitoring setup) rather than system components, following Di√°taxis how-to guide format with clear goal statements, prerequisites, step-by-step procedures, verification steps, and troubleshooting guidance

**Procedural Writing Standards**: Begin procedures with action verbs, use numbered lists for sequential steps, include expected outcomes after each step, provide command examples with actual syntax, explain parameters and options, include screenshots or terminal output examples, and add warnings/cautions before potentially destructive operations

**Configuration Examples**: Provide complete, working configuration file examples with inline comments explaining each setting, use syntax highlighting appropriate to file type, include environment-specific variations (dev, staging, production), and maintain example configurations as testable code

**Validation & Quality Assurance**: Implement automated testing of documentation with Vale for style consistency, markdownlint for Markdown formatting, spell checkers for typos, link checkers for broken references, and code snippet validators to ensure command examples remain current
