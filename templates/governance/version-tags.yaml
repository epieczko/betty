# PURPOSE
# Version tags define naming conventions and versioning strategies for git tags, container images, artifacts, and deployed services following Semantic Versioning 2.0.0. They enable artifact identification, deployment targeting, rollback operations, and compliance audit trails across development, CI/CD

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Semantic Versioning Compliance: Strictly follow SemVer 2.0.0 - MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH with clear breaking change communication
# - Immutable Tags: Never reuse or overwrite version tags - each version is immutable forever
# - Annotated Git Tags: Use git annotated tags (git tag -a v1.2.3) with release descriptions, not lightweight tags
# - v-Prefix Convention: Prefix git tags with 'v' (v1.2.3) to distinguish from other tag types
# - Automated Tagging: Use GitVersion or semantic-release for consistent, automated version calculation

# Main content - customize based on artifact type
