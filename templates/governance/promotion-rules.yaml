# PURPOSE
# This artifact codifies promotion governance policies as enforceable rules using policy-as-code, defining quality thresholds, security requirements, compliance validations, and approval criteria that gate environment promotions. It enables automated, consistent policy enforcement across all promotion

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Policy as Code: Store promotion rules in Git as OPA policies, Kyverno rules, or platform-specific configurations, ve
# - Automated Enforcement: Integrate policy evaluation into CI/CD pipelines, fail builds/deployments on policy violations
# - Clear Feedback: Provide actionable error messages when rules fail, guide developers to remediation steps
# - Graduated Rules: Apply stricter rules for higher environments (dev → staging → production)
# - Risk-Based Rules: Set thresholds based on risk (critical apps require higher quality gates)
