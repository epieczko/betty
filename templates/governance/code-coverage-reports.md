## Executive Summary

<!-- Provide a 2-3 paragraph overview for executive audience -->
<!-- What is this document about and why does it matter? -->

## Purpose

<!-- Code Coverage Reports provide objective, measurable data on test suite effectiveness to support engineering quality decisions. They answer critical questions: "Are our critical code paths tested?", "W... -->

## Scope

### In Scope

- Unit test coverage metrics (line, branch, statement, function coverage)
- Integration and end-to-end test coverage measurement
- Coverage by module, package, class, and function
- Coverage trends over time (historical analysis)
- Critical path coverage analysis (security, payments, data handling)

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered by this artifact

## Target Audience

### Primary Audience

- Software Engineers: Review coverage gaps for their code, ensure new code meets thresholds
- Engineering Managers: Monitor team quality metrics, set coverage standards, track trends
- QA/Test Engineers: Identify untested scenarios, prioritize test case creation

### Secondary Audience

- Additional stakeholders who may reference this document

## Best Practices

**Branch Coverage Over Line Coverage**: Prioritize branch/decision coverage over simple line coverage; 80% branch coverage is more meaningful than 95% line coverage with poor decision path testing

**Critical Path Focus**: Mandate higher coverage (90-100%) for security-critical code, payment processing, data integrity logic, authentication/authorization

**Quality Gates in CI/CD**: Block pull request merges if new code falls below threshold (e.g., 80% coverage); use tools like SonarQube quality gates, Codecov status checks

**Coverage Trending**: Track coverage trends over time; declining coverage signals technical debt accumulation; use dashboards (SonarQube, Codecov, Coveralls)

**Differential Coverage**: Focus on new/changed code coverage in PRs; legacy code may have low coverage, but new code should meet standards
