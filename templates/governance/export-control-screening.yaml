# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - ECCN Self-Classification: Determine ECCN for all software products before distribution; document classification rationale; ret
# - Encryption Registration: File one-time BIS encryption registration within 30 days of first export; update annually if product
# - Mass Market Eligibility: Verify mass market encryption criteria (≤64-bit symmetric, consumer products, retail availability) f
# - TSU/ENC Exceptions: Leverage License Exception TSU for publicly available software; use ENC exception for encryption pro
# - Denied Party Screening: Screen all international customers, distributors, end-users against consolidated screening lists bef
