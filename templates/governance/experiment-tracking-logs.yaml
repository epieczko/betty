# PURPOSE
# This artifact serves as the authoritative record of all experimentation activities, capturing experiment design, execution, statistical analysis, and outcomes. It enables reproducibility of experiments, prevents duplicate tests, facilitates meta-analysis across experiments, and provides evidence for...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Pre-Registration: Document experiment hypothesis, metrics, and analysis plan before launching to prevent p-hacking
# - Power Analysis: Calculate required sample size to detect MDE with 80% power and 5% significance level before startin
# - Single Primary Metric: Define one primary decision metric to avoid multiple comparison issues; secondary metrics for learni
# - Guardrail Metrics: Monitor key business metrics (revenue, retention, engagement) to detect unintended negative impacts
# - Statistical Significance: Use p < 0.05 threshold for significance; require 95% confidence intervals that exclude zero
