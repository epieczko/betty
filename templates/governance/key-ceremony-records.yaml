# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Ceremony Scripts: Develop detailed ceremony scripts with numbered steps, checkpoints, and rollback procedures; peer-re
# - Rehearsal Required: Conduct full rehearsal of ceremony with dummy keys; validate all procedures, equipment, and timings 
# - FIPS 140-2 HSMs: Use only FIPS 140-2 Level 3 (or higher) validated HSMs for root CA keys; verify HSM firmware signatu
# - Split Knowledge: Enforce strict split knowledge - no single person should ever possess complete key material or suffi
# - M-of-N Thresholds: Implement M-of-N schemes (e.g., 3-of-5) for key backup; distribute components to trusted custodians
