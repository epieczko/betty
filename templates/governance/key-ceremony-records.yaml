# PURPOSE
# This artifact serves as authoritative documentation of high-assurance key generation ceremonies including root CA key pair generation, HSM master key initialization, key backup and escrow procedures, and recovery drills. It provides evidence of split knowledge and dual control enforcement, witness a

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Ceremony Scripts: Develop detailed ceremony scripts with numbered steps, checkpoints, and rollback procedures; peer-re
# - Rehearsal Required: Conduct full rehearsal of ceremony with dummy keys; validate all procedures, equipment, and timings 
# - FIPS 140-2 HSMs: Use only FIPS 140-2 Level 3 (or higher) validated HSMs for root CA keys; verify HSM firmware signatu
# - Split Knowledge: Enforce strict split knowledge - no single person should ever possess complete key material or suffi
# - M-of-N Thresholds: Implement M-of-N schemes (e.g., 3-of-5) for key backup; distribute components to trusted custodians
