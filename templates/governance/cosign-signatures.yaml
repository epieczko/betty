# PURPOSE
# This artifact serves as the authoritative record of cryptographic signatures applied to container images, binary artifacts, and software packages using Sigstore Cosign. It documents signature metadata including public keys, OIDC identity claims, Rekor transparency log entries, and verification resul...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Keyless Signing Default: Use OIDC-based keyless signing with Fulcio for ephemeral certificates to eliminate key management bu
# - Rekor Transparency: Always publish signatures to Rekor transparency log for auditability and non-repudiation
# - SLSA Provenance: Combine Cosign signatures with SLSA provenance attestations for comprehensive build integrity
# - Multi-Arch Signing: Sign all platform-specific images individually and create signed image index for multi-arch manifest
# - Policy-as-Code: Define signature verification policies in Kyverno or OPA for automated admission control
