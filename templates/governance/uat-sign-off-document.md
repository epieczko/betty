## Best Practices

**Acceptance Criteria Upfront**: Define measurable acceptance criteria during requirements gathering, not during UAT execution

**Representative Test Data**: Use production-like data volumes and realistic scenarios that reflect actual business operations

**Business User Involvement**: Ensure actual end users (not just BAs or proxy testers) participate in UAT execution

**Traceability Matrix**: Maintain complete RTM linking every requirement to test cases and execution results

**Evidence Collection**: Capture screenshots, screen recordings, and log exports for critical test scenarios as proof of execution
