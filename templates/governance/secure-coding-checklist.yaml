# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - SAST Integration: Integrate static analysis tools (SonarQube, Checkmarx, Snyk Code) into CI/CD pipelines with quality 
# - OWASP Top 10 Mapping: Map each checklist item to specific OWASP Top 10 and CWE categories for traceability and reporting
# - Language-Specific Checks: Customize checklist per language (Python Bandit rules, JavaScript ESLint security, Java SpotBugs)
# - Input Validation First: Prioritize allowlist-based input validation over denylist approaches; validate all inputs at trust b
# - Cryptographic Standards: Mandate TLS 1.2+ for transport, AES-256 for encryption, secure random generation (java.security.Secu
