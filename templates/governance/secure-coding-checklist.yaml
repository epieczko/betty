# PURPOSE
# This artifact serves as a systematic verification checklist ensuring code adheres to secure coding standards, preventing injection attacks (SQL, XSS, Command), broken authentication, security misconfigurations, insecure deserialization, XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, and other OWASP Top 10 vulne

# BEST PRACTICES
# - SAST Integration: Integrate static analysis tools (SonarQube, Checkmarx, Snyk Code) into CI/CD pipelines with quality 
# - OWASP Top 10 Mapping: Map each checklist item to specific OWASP Top 10 and CWE categories for traceability and reporting
# - Language-Specific Checks: Customize checklist per language (Python Bandit rules, JavaScript ESLint security, Java SpotBugs)
# - Input Validation First: Prioritize allowlist-based input validation over denylist approaches; validate all inputs at trust b
# - Cryptographic Standards: Mandate TLS 1.2+ for transport, AES-256 for encryption, secure random generation (java.security.Secu
