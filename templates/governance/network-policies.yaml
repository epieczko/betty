# PURPOSE
# This artifact defines Layer 3/Layer 4 network segmentation rules that control traffic flow between pods, namespaces, and external networks within Kubernetes clusters. It implements zero-trust networking principles by specifying which workloads can communicate with each other based on labels, namespa...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Default Deny All: Implement default deny-all policies for both ingress and egress as baseline security posture
# - Incremental Rollout: Deploy network policies incrementally, starting with audit mode before enforcement
# - Label Standardization: Establish consistent labeling conventions for pod and namespace selectors across organization
# - Namespace Isolation: Implement namespace-level isolation to prevent cross-tenant traffic by default
# - DNS Allowlisting: Use FQDN-based policies (Cilium) to control egress to specific external domains
