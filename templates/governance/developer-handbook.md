## Executive Summary

<!-- Provide a 2-3 paragraph overview for executive audience -->
<!-- What is this document about and why does it matter? -->

## Purpose

<!-- The Developer Handbook serves as the single source of truth for engineering practices, accelerating developer onboarding, standardizing development workflows, and capturing institutional knowledge abo... -->

## Scope

### In Scope

- Development environment setup (IDE configuration, language runtimes, development tools, local database setup)
- Coding standards and style guides (language-specific conventions, naming conventions, code formatting, linting rules)
- Git workflow and branching strategy (GitFlow, trunk-based development, feature branches, commit message conventions)
- Pull request and code review process (PR templates, review checklists, approval workflows)
- CI/CD pipeline documentation (build processes, automated testing, deployment procedures, release workflows)

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered by this artifact

## Target Audience

### Primary Audience

- Software Engineers (frontend, backend, full-stack) building and maintaining applications
- New hires onboarding to engineering team and codebase
- Junior developers learning team standards and best practices

### Secondary Audience

- Additional stakeholders who may reference this document

## [Main Section 1]

## [Main Section 2]

<!-- Add additional sections as needed -->

## Best Practices

**Docs-as-Code Integration**: Store developer handbook in Git repository alongside application code (monorepo or docs repository), implement pull request workflow for documentation updates, run automated testing on documentation changes (link checking, linting, code example validation), and deploy automatically on merge to main branch

**Onboarding-First Structure**: Design table of contents to follow new developer onboarding journey (environment setup → codebase tour → first contribution → advanced topics), create "Getting Started in 30 Minutes" quick-start guide, provide setup automation scripts (bootstrap scripts, Docker Compose environments), and maintain troubleshooting section for common setup issues

**Code Example Standards**: Provide complete, runnable code examples that developers can copy-paste, test all code examples in CI/CD pipeline, include language-specific syntax highlighting, show both successful and error cases, add comments explaining non-obvious code, and maintain examples for all supported languages/frameworks

**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document significant technical decisions using ADR format (Context, Decision, Consequences), store ADRs with documentation in version control, create ADRs before implementing major changes, link ADRs to related code via comments, and maintain ADR index for discoverability

**Interactive Documentation**: Embed live code playgrounds (CodeSandbox, StackBlitz, JSFiddle), provide "Try it Now" API examples with authentication, include interactive diagrams using Mermaid or PlantUML, add copy-to-clipboard buttons for code snippets, and create video walkthroughs for complex procedures
