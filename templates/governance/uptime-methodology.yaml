# This artifact standardizes uptime calculation methodologies, maintenance window management, multi-region deployment strategies, and SLA credit administration. It defines availability formulas (uptime minutes / total minutes), planned maintenance exclusions, multi-AZ/multi-region patterns, status pag...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Monthly Calculation: Calculate uptime monthly (calendar month) for consistency with billing cycles and SLA reporting
# - Maintenance Windows: Schedule during low-traffic hours (2-6 AM local time); limit to 4 hours max; provide 7-14 days notic
# - Exclude Planned: Exclude planned maintenance from uptime calculations if advance notice given and during designated w
# - Multi-Region Buffer: Deploy to 3+ regions/AZs; design for single region failure without service impact
# - Health Checks: Implement deep health checks beyond simple HTTP 200 (database connectivity, dependency health)
