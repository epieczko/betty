# PURPOSE
# This artifact provides comprehensive visibility into service dependencies to support impact analysis, failure domain design, deployment orchestration, and operational troubleshooting. It solves the problem of unknown dependencies in distributed systems by automatically discovering, documenting, and 

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Automated Discovery: Use service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) and distributed tracing (Jaeger/X-Ray) for automatic dependency det
# - Real-Time Updates: Keep graph current through continuous integration with observability platforms
# - Multiple Views: Provide logical view (service-level), physical view (instance-level), and network view (IP/ports)
# - Dependency Metadata: Capture call volumes, latency, error rates, timeout/retry configs for each dependency
# - Failure Domain Mapping: Group services by failure domain boundaries (AZ, region, team, bounded context)
