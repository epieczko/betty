## Core Values

### Our Guiding Principles

**Value 1: [Value Name]**
**Definition:** [What this value means]
**In Practice:** [Behaviors that demonstrate this value]
**Decision Framework:** [How this value guides trade-offs]

**Value 2: [Value Name]**
**Definition:** [What this value means]
**In Practice:** [Behaviors that demonstrate this value]
**Decision Framework:** [How this value guides trade-offs]

**Value 3: [Value Name]**
**Definition:** [What this value means]
**In Practice:** [Behaviors that demonstrate this value]
**Decision Framework:** [How this value guides trade-offs]

**Example:**

**Value 1: Customer Obsession**
**Definition:** We start with customer needs and work backwards, never accepting "good enough" when customers deserve better.
**In Practice:**
- Every feature decision includes customer interviews and validation
- Support response time <1 hour for critical issues
- Product team spends 5+ hours weekly in customer conversations
- Customer NPS is reviewed in weekly leadership meetings
**Decision Framework:** When choosing between internal convenience and customer value, choose customer value.

**Value 2: Ownership & Accountability**
**Definition:** We act like owners, taking responsibility for outcomes and proactively solving problems without waiting for permission.
**In Practice:**
- Engineers own their services end-to-end (build it, run it, support it)
- No "that's not my job" culture—we solve problems we see
- Post-mortems focus on learning, not blaming
- Everyone has equity ownership in company success
**Decision Framework:** When facing unclear ownership, take ownership rather than escalating.

**Value 3: Bias for Action**
**Definition:** We value speed of iteration over perfection, making reversible decisions quickly and learning from real-world feedback.
**In Practice:**
- Ship MVPs to beta customers within 2 weeks of ideation
- Favor A/B testing over debating in conference rooms
- Make reversible decisions at lowest possible level (leadership only for one-way doors)
- Fail fast, learn faster—celebrate intelligent experiments that don't work out
**Decision Framework:** When uncertain, run a small experiment rather than endless analysis.

**Value 4: Transparency & Direct Communication**
**Definition:** We share information openly, communicate directly (even when uncomfortable), and assume positive intent.
**In Practice:**
- All company metrics visible to all employees (ARR, churn, runway, metrics)
- Compensation philosophy and bands published internally
- Deliver critical feedback directly within 24 hours
- Leaders share both wins and challenges in all-hands
**Decision Framework:** When in doubt, over-communicate and be radically candid.

**Value 5: Continuous Learning**
**Definition:** We embrace intellectual curiosity, seek feedback eagerly, and view every situation as opportunity to improve.
**In Practice:**
- $1,500 annual learning budget per employee
- Weekly Friday "learning time" for exploration
- Blameless post-mortems for all incidents
- Peer code reviews and design critiques as standard practice
**Decision Framework:** When choosing between proven approach and learning opportunity, bias toward learning.

- **Current State:** 12,500 active pipelines
- **Why This Matters:** Each active pipeline represents a data team spending time analyzing (not maintaining) and making faster business decisions—directly fulfilling our mission of empowering data teams.

## Mission → Tactical Alignment

### How Mission Connects to Daily Work

```
MISSION: Empower every data team
   ↓
VISION: 100,000 enterprises by 2029
   ↓
STRATEGIC PILLARS: Product-Led Growth | Platform Expansion | Ecosystem | Operational Excellence
   ↓
ANNUAL OKRs: Specific objectives for 2025
   ↓
QUARTERLY OKRS: Q1 2025 team objectives

INDIVIDUAL OKRs: Personal contributions
   ↓
WEEKLY PRIORITIES: Sprint commitments
```

### Example OKR Connection

**Mission:** Empower every data team

**Strategic Pillar:** Product-Led Growth

**Annual Objective:** Achieve product-led growth as primary acquisition channel

**Q1 OKR:**
- Objective: Reduce time-to-value for new users
- KR1: Time-to-first-pipeline < 15 minutes (baseline: 45 min)
- KR2: Free-to-paid conversion rate >12% (baseline: 8%)
- KR3: PQL weekly volume >500/week (baseline: 200/week)

## Values in Tension

**When Values Conflict:**

Sometimes our values create tension. Here's how we navigate trade-offs:

**Speed vs. Quality:**
We bias toward speed for reversible decisions, quality for irreversible ones. Launch MVPs fast, but build security and core architecture right.

**Transparency vs. Confidentiality:**
Default to transparency, but protect customer data, unreleased product plans, and board-level strategic decisions requiring confidentiality.

**Customer Obsession vs. Sustainable Business:**
Solve customer problems profitably. We can't serve customers long-term if we're out of business.

**Autonomy vs. Alignment:**
Give teams maximum autonomy within strategic pillars and guardrails. Coordinate when cross-team dependencies exist.
