# PURPOSE
# This artifact defines cost anomaly detection systems, budget alert configurations, spending forecasting methodologies, and cost optimization workflows. It establishes ML-powered anomaly thresholds, cost allocation tagging, unit economics tracking, and notification routing for unexpected cloud spendi...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Tagging Enforcement: Require cost allocation tags (team, project, environment, cost-center) on all resources; reject unta
# - Tiered Alerts: Set budget alerts at 50% (info), 80% (warning), 90% (critical), 100% (breach) thresholds
# - Anomaly Thresholds: Configure anomaly detection for >20% daily variance, >30% weekly variance from ML baseline
# - Unit Economics: Track cost per request, cost per user, cost per GB to identify efficiency trends and regressions
# - Daily Reviews: Review cost dashboards daily; investigate anomalies >$100/day immediately
