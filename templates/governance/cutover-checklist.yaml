# PURPOSE
# This artifact provides a comprehensive, actionable checklist of all tasks, validations, approvals, and communication steps required for successful production deployment or system cutover, ensuring nothing is forgotten and all stakeholders are aligned before go-live.

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Comprehensive Coverage: Include every critical task; missing one item can cause deployment failure
# - Ordered Execution: Sequence tasks in proper order with clear dependencies and prerequisites
# - Clear Ownership: Assign each checklist item to specific person/team responsible for execution
# - Rollback Ready: Define clear rollback criteria and validate rollback procedures before go-live
# - Smoke Tests Mandatory: Never skip smoke tests; always validate critical functionality post-deployment
