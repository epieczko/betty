## Best Practices

**Quarterly Cadence Minimum**: Conduct access reviews at minimum quarterly; more frequently (monthly) for privileged and production access

**Manager Accountability**: Assign attestation responsibility to direct managers who understand business need for access, not IT teams

**Automated Campaign Launch**: Trigger review campaigns automatically via IGA platform integration with HRIS for current reporting relationships

**Risk-Based Prioritization**: Prioritize high-risk access first (privileged accounts, SOD violations, orphaned accounts) before standard user access

**Clear Attestation Questions**: Ask "Should this person still have this access?" not technical jargon about entitlements and permissions
