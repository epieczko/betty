## Best Practices

**Token Bucket Recommended**: Use token bucket algorithm for most APIs - allows bursts while enforcing sustained rate

**Per-Consumer Rate Limiting**: Rate limit by API key, user ID, or tenant - not just by IP address

**Multiple Time Windows**: Implement rate limits at multiple granularities (per second, minute, hour, day)

**Generous Free Tier**: Provide meaningful free tier quota for developers to build and test integrations

**Clear Documentation**: Publish rate limits prominently in API documentation with examples
