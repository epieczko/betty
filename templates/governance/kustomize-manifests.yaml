It enables teams to maintain a single source of truth for base configurations while applying targeted customiza...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Minimal Overlays: Keep overlays small - override only what differs from base, avoiding duplication
# - Base Reusability: Design bases to be reusable across multiple environments and teams
# - Semantic Versioning: Version remote bases using Git tags following semantic versioning
# - Hash Suffixes: Enable hash suffixes for ConfigMaps/Secrets to trigger rolling updates on changes
# - Strategic Merge First: Prefer strategic merge patches over JSON patches for better readability
