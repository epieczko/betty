# PURPOSE
# This artifact serves as the lightweight business case and authorization document for large initiatives (epics), defining the business problem, solution hypothesis, expected outcomes, success metrics, MVP scope, investment estimate, and go/no-go criteria. It enables portfolio-level decision-making on

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Hypothesis-Driven: Frame epic as testable hypothesis (we believe X will result in Y as measured by Z)
# - Lean Business Case: Keep lightweight; avoid traditional heavy business case documentation
# - Outcome-Focused: Define success by business outcomes and metrics, not outputs or features
# - MVP Definition: Clearly define minimum viable product scope for initial validation
# - Leading/Lagging Indicators: Specify both leading (predictive) and lagging (outcome) success metrics
