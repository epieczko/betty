# PURPOSE
# Provides machine-readable and human-readable records of user consent transactions with cryptographic proof, enabling organizations to demonstrate GDPR Article 7(1) burden of proof compliance, respond to DSAR requests within 30-day SLA, and defend against privacy litigation with tamper-evident audit 

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Kantara v1.1 Compliance: Implement full Consent Receipt Specification v1.1 schema including jurisdiction, piiPrincipalId, ser
# - Cryptographic Integrity: Generate SHA-256 hash of consent transaction payload with RSA-2048 or ECDSA P-256 digital signatures
# - Blockchain Anchoring: Submit consent receipt hashes to immutable ledger (Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum) for third-party ver
# - 30-Day DSAR SLA: Automate GDPR Article 15 responses by generating consent history exports within 7-10 days (vs 30-day
# - CMP Synchronization: Bi-directional sync between consent receipts and CMP platforms (OneTrust, TrustArc) every 15 minutes
