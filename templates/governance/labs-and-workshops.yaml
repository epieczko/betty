# PURPOSE
# Labs and Workshops provide structured, hands-on training that accelerates skill development through practical application and experimentation in safe, isolated environments. They solve the problem of passive learning by engaging learners with real-world scenarios, providing immediate feedback, and b

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Learning Outcomes First: Define clear, measurable learning objectives using Bloom's Taxonomy action verbs (e.g., "By completi
# - Scaffolded Progression: Structure labs with progressive difficulty (simple concepts first, build to complex applications), p
# - Hands-On First Approach: Maximize active learning time (80% doing, 20% reading/watching), provide immediate feedback through 
# - Reproducible Environments: Automate environment setup with scripts (Docker Compose, Terraform, shell scripts), version-pin all 
# - Clear Instructions with Verification: Write step-by-step instructions with expected outcomes after each step, include verification command
