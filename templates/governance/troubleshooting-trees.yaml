# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Start with Symptoms, Not Solutions: Begin decision trees with observable symptoms (customer impact, error messages, alerts) rather than 
# - Binary Decision Logic: Use clear yes/no questions at each decision node to minimize ambiguity and enable rapid navigation
# - Maximum 3-5 Levels Deep: Keep trees shallow to prevent cognitive overload; deeper diagnostics should branch to separate detai
# - Link to Runbooks: Each terminal node should reference specific runbooks or remediation procedures rather than embeddin
# - Include Diagnostic Commands: Provide exact CLI commands, API calls, or dashboard queries needed at each decision point
