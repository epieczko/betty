# PURPOSE
# This artifact standardizes error classification, error code formats, exception hierarchies, and error response structures across all services and APIs. It defines HTTP status codes usage, gRPC status codes, custom application error codes (ERR-1001, AUTH-403-01), error message templates, retry semant...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - 4xx vs 5xx: Use 4xx for client errors (bad request, auth failure) that don't count against SLOs; 5xx for system 
# - Specific Status Codes: Use precise codes (401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 429 Too Many Requests, 503 Servic
# - gRPC Status Codes: Map to gRPC canonical codes (INVALID_ARGUMENT, UNAUTHENTICATED, PERMISSION_DENIED, UNAVAILABLE)
# - Structured Errors: Return JSON error objects with code, message, details, request_id, documentation_url
# - Error Code Format: Use hierarchical codes (AUTH-401-001, VAL-400-002, SYS-500-001) for categorization
