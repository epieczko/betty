## Purpose

<!-- This artifact aggregates and analyzes lessons from multiple incidents to identify patterns, track remediation effectiveness, and guide strategic reliability investments. It solves the problem of organ... -->

## Scope

### In Scope

- Incident trend analysis (frequency by severity, service, cause category over time)
- Top failure modes and root causes (Pareto analysis of contributing factors)
- Recurring incident patterns requiring systemic remediation
- Action item completion tracking and effectiveness metrics

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered by this artifact

## Target Audience

### Primary Audience

## [Main Section 2]

<!-- Add additional sections as needed -->

## Best Practices

**Regular Cadence**: Publish lessons learned quarterly or semi-annually; don't wait for annual reviews

**Data-Driven**: Use metrics, not anecdotes; quantify incident frequency, MTTR trends, action item completion rates

**Pareto Analysis**: Identify the 20% of root causes driving 80% of incidents; focus remediation efforts there

**Pattern Recognition**: Group similar incidents to identify systemic issues requiring architectural changes

**Actionable Insights**: Every lesson should translate to specific recommended actions, not just observations
