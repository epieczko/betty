# BEST PRACTICES
# - Ownership Assignment Principles: - **Single Team Accountability**: Each service should have exactly one team as primary owner
# - SRE and Operational Excellence: - **SLO Ownership**: Each service owner defines and monitors SLOs (availability, latency, error rate
# - DORA Capabilities and Metrics: - **Deployment Ownership**: Teams own their CI/CD pipelines and deployment process
# - Incident Management Best Practices: - **Clear Escalation**: Document primary on-call, secondary backup, manager escalation
# - Platform and Service Boundaries: - **Service Catalog**: Publish what platform teams provide and support levels
