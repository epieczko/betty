## Risk Appetite Philosophy

### Overall Risk Appetite Statement

[Organization Name] has a **[LOW | MODERATE | HIGH]** overall risk appetite, balanced with our strategic objectives and stakeholder expectations. We are willing to accept **[quantitative threshold]** in pursuit of **[strategic goals]**, while maintaining **[key constraints or boundaries]**.

**Example 1: Financial Services**
GlobalBank has a **MODERATE** overall risk appetite, balanced with our commitment to sustainable profitability and customer trust. We are willing to accept calculated credit and market risks in pursuit of 12-15% return on equity, while maintaining Tier 1 capital ratio above 12% and operational loss events under $50M annually.

**Example 2: Technology Company**
TechCorp has a **HIGH** appetite for strategic and product risks that support rapid innovation, accepting up to 30% failure rate on experimental initiatives. However, we maintain **LOW** appetite for cyber security, data privacy, and compliance risks—accepting zero tolerance for customer data breaches or regulatory violations.

**Example 3: Healthcare Organization**
HealthSystem has a **LOW** risk appetite for patient safety and clinical quality risks (zero tolerance for preventable harm), **MODERATE** appetite for operational and financial risks (5-10% annual fluctuation in operating margin acceptable), and **MODERATE TO HIGH** appetite for strategic transformation risks supporting value-based care transition.

## Risk Capacity vs. Risk Appetite vs. Risk Tolerance

### Definitions

**Risk Capacity:** The maximum risk the organization CAN absorb based on financial resources, balance sheet strength, and capital position.

**Risk Appetite:** The level of risk the organization is WILLING to accept in pursuit of strategic objectives.

**Risk Tolerance:** The acceptable variance around risk appetite (green/yellow/red zones).

**Example:**

**Financial Loss Example:**
- **Risk Capacity:** Maximum single loss of $100M before threatening solvency (based on balance sheet strength)
- **Risk Appetite:** Willing to accept up to $25M annual aggregate loss from operational risks
- **Risk Tolerance Zones:**
  - **GREEN (Acceptable):** $0-15M annual operational losses
  - **YELLOW (Monitor):** $15M-25M annual operational losses (increased monitoring and mitigation required)
  - **RED (Breach):** >$25M annual operational losses (immediate Board escalation and corrective action)
