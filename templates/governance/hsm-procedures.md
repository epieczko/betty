## Executive Summary

<!-- Provide a 2-3 paragraph overview for executive audience -->
<!-- What is this document about and why does it matter? -->

## Purpose

- Key backup and cloning (HSM-to-HSM secure transfer)

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered by this artifact

## Target Audience

### Primary Audience

- Crypto Officers performing daily HSM operations and key management
- HSM Administrators configuring partitions, policies, and access controls
- Security Engineers integrating applications with HSM services

### Secondary Audience

- Additional stakeholders who may reference this document

## [Main Section 2]

<!-- Add additional sections as needed -->

## Best Practices

**FIPS Mode Always**: Initialize HSMs in FIPS 140-2 mode; never operate in non-FIPS mode for production; verify FIPS validation certificate

**Dual Control**: Implement dual control for all critical operations; require minimum 2 crypto officers for key generation, backup, restore

**M-of-N Authentication**: Use M-of-N quorum authentication (e.g., 3-of-5 COs required) for high-security operations

**Partition Isolation**: Create separate HSM partitions per application/environment; isolate development, staging, production keys

**Role Separation**: Maintain strict separation between Security Officer (SO) and Crypto Officer (CO) roles; never combine roles
