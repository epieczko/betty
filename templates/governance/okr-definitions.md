## Executive Summary

This document defines the Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for Q1 2025 following the methodology popularized by John Doerr's "Measure What Matters" and practiced at Google, Intel, and LinkedIn. OKRs create cascading alignment from company-level goals to product and team execution, ensuring every initiative connects to strategic priorities.

**Purpose**: Define quarterly goals (Objectives) and measurable success criteria (Key Results) that drive product strategy execution and organizational alignment.

**Strategic Value**: Enables focus on highest-impact work, transparent progress tracking, and 70% achievement target (stretch goals) that drives ambitious thinking.

## 1. OKR Framework Principles

### Core Components

| Component | Definition | Characteristics | Example |
|-----------|------------|----------------|---------|
| **Objective** | Qualitative, inspirational goal | • Action-oriented<br>• Memorable<br>• Time-bound (quarterly/annual)<br>• Inspiring | "Become the #1 choice for enterprise customers" |
| **Key Result** | Quantitative, measurable outcome | • Specific number/percentage<br>• Verifiable<br>• Aggressive but realistic<br>• Outcome-focused (not output) | "Increase enterprise ARR from $12M to $18M" |
| **Initiative** | How we achieve KRs (optional) | • Projects/actions<br>• Not part of official OKR<br>• Tracked separately | "Launch enterprise SSO feature" |

### Grading Scale (0.0 - 1.0)

| Score | Interpretation | Action |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **0.7 - 1.0** | Excellent performance (stretch goal met/exceeded) | Celebrate success; consider higher targets next quarter |
| **0.4 - 0.6** | Moderate progress; goal was ambitious | Analyze blockers; adjust targets or increase resources |
| **0.0 - 0.3** | Significant underperformance | Reassess goal validity; investigate fundamental issues |

**Target**: 0.7 average across all OKRs (70% achievement indicates appropriate stretch)

## 5. OKR Check-in & Tracking Cadence

### Weekly Check-ins (Monday standup)

**Format**:
- **Red/Yellow/Green status** for each KR
- **Blockers and asks** (what help do you need?)
- **Key decisions or pivots** made

**Example Check-in**:
```
OKR: Accelerate Enterprise Acquisition
KR1 (Enterprise ARR $18M): 🟡 Yellow - $14.5M (+$2.5M this month)
  - On track for $18M target
  - Blocker: Legal review slowing 2 large deals
  - Ask: Expedite legal resources for enterprise contracts

KR2 (15 new enterprise deals): 🟡 Yellow - 6 deals closed, 9 to go
  - Pipeline strong (25 qualified opps)
  - Risk: Q1 budget cycles may delay decisions
  - Mitigation: Offering Q2 start dates with Q1 pricing

KR3 (Sales cycle 90 days): 🟢 Green - 105 days (was 120)
  - Ahead of target; new sales playbook effective
  - Continue momentum with enablement training

KR4 (90% retention, 110% NRR): 🟢 Green - 88% retention, trending to 90%+
  - CS team executing well on renewals
  - Expansion revenue from SSO feature helping NRR
```

### Mid-Quarter Review (Week 6)

**Purpose**: Assess progress, adjust targets if necessary, reallocate resources

**Agenda**:
1. Score each KR at midpoint (0.0-1.0 scale)
2. Identify KRs at risk (<0.3 expected final score)
3. Decide: Continue / Adjust target / Shift resources / Drop KR
4. Document learnings and course corrections

### End-of-Quarter Grading (Week 13)

**Grading Process**:
1. Calculate final score for each KR (0.0-1.0)
2. Average scores for each Objective
3. Calculate company-wide OKR average
4. Document learnings in retrospective

**Retrospective Questions**:
- What worked well? (keep doing)
- What didn't work? (stop doing)
- What contributed to success/failure?
- Were targets appropriately ambitious?
- Should any OKRs roll over to Q2?

## 6. OKR Best Practices & Anti-Patterns

### Best Practices

| Practice | Why It Matters | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Outcome-focused KRs** | Measures impact, not activity | ✅ "Increase ARR by 50%" not ❌ "Launch 5 features" |
| **Stretch targets (0.7 success)** | Drives ambitious thinking | ✅ Target 100% knowing 70% is excellent |
| **Limited focus (3-5 OKRs)** | Prevents dilution of effort | ✅ 3 company OKRs, 3-4 team OKRs per team |
| **Clear ownership (DRI)** | Ensures accountability | ✅ Every OKR has one Directly Responsible Individual |
| **Transparent to all** | Enables coordination | ✅ All OKRs visible company-wide in Lattice/Confluence |
| **Bottom-up + top-down** | Balances strategy with reality | ✅ Execs set company OKRs, teams propose supporting OKRs |

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| **Too many OKRs** | Dilutes focus, nothing gets done well | ❌ 10 OKRs → ✅ 3-4 OKRs maximum |
| **Sandbagging (100% targets)** | Discourages ambitious goals | ❌ Easy targets → ✅ Stretch goals (0.7 = success) |
| **Activity-based KRs** | Measures output, not impact | ❌ "Ship feature X" → ✅ "Increase engagement 40%" |
| **Cascading too rigidly** | Kills team autonomy and creativity | ❌ Prescribed team OKRs → ✅ Teams propose how to support |
| **Set and forget** | No adjustment when reality changes | ❌ Quarterly set-it → ✅ Weekly check-ins, mid-quarter review |
| **Confusing OKRs with KPIs** | KPIs are ongoing metrics; OKRs are goals | ❌ "Maintain 99% uptime" (KPI) → ✅ "Improve uptime to 99.9%" (OKR) |

## 7. OKR Alignment & Dependencies

### Cascading Alignment

```
Company OKR:
  └─> "Accelerate Enterprise Acquisition" (ARR $18M, 15 deals, 90-day cycle, 90% retention)
      │
      ├─> Product OKR:
      │   └─> "Ship Enterprise Capabilities" (SSO, RBAC, 99.9% uptime, SOC 2)
      │       │
      │       └─> Engineering OKR:
      │           └─> "Build Scalable Infrastructure" (p99 latency, 100K users, multi-region)
      │
      ├─> Sales OKR:
      │   └─> "Optimize Enterprise Sales Motion" (15 deals, 90-day cycle)
      │
      └─> Marketing OKR:
          └─> "Generate Enterprise Pipeline" (500 MQLs, 50 SQLs, 15 opportunities)
```

**Dependency Mapping**:

| Dependent OKR | Depends On | Risk if Blocker | Mitigation |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Sales: 15 enterprise deals | Product: SSO, RBAC shipped | High - deals contingent on features | Weekly Product-Sales sync; beta access program |
| Product: 90% adoption of SSO | Engineering: SSO shipped on time | Medium - delays adoption metric | Parallel beta testing while building |
| Engineering: Multi-region deployment | Finance: Cloud budget approved | Low - budgeted | Pre-approved in annual plan |
