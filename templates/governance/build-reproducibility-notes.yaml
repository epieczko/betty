# PURPOSE
# This artifact documents the technical requirements, environmental specifications, and verification procedures necessary to achieve bit-for-bit reproducible builds, enabling independent verification of software artifacts and establishing trusted build provenance aligned with SLSA Framework and supply

# BEST PRACTICES
# - SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH: Set SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH environment variable to git commit timestamp for reproducible timestamps
# - Pin All Dependencies: Lock every dependency to exact versions with cryptographic checksums in lock files
# - Hermetic Builds: Isolate builds from system state; disable network access during build execution
# - Fixed Tool Versions: Pin exact versions of all build tools, compilers, and SDKs (no "latest" tags)
# - Deterministic Compression: Use deterministic tar/zip options (--sort=name, --mtime, --clamp-mtime)

# Main content - customize based on artifact type
