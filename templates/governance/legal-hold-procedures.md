## Best Practices

**Immediate Action**: Issue legal hold notices within 24-48 hours of litigation trigger to demonstrate good faith preservation

**Overcollection Preferred**: Preserve broadly initially; narrow scope later to avoid inadvertent destruction of relevant evidence

**Written Hold Notices**: Always issue written hold notices (email acceptable) with clear subject lines and acknowledgment requirements

**Custodian Acknowledgment**: Require affirmative acknowledgment from all custodians; track and escalate for non-responders

**Suspend Auto-Delete**: Immediately suspend all automated deletion policies, retention rules, and scheduled purges for in-scope data
