## Best Practices

**Contract-First Development**: Create and agree on ICD before implementation begins to enable parallel development

**Complete API Specifications**: Provide full OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/Protobuf schemas with all endpoints, operations, and data models

**Comprehensive Examples**: Include request/response examples for all operations including success and error scenarios

**Explicit Error Catalog**: Document all possible error conditions with codes, messages, and recommended consumer actions

**Clear Data Semantics**: Define precise meaning, constraints, and business rules for every field in payloads
