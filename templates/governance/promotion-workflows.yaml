# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - GitOps Pattern: Use Git as single source of truth, all promotions via pull requests, maintain environment-specific b
# - Progressive Promotion: Promote through dev → staging → production sequentially, require successful validation at each stage
# - Automated Validation: Implement comprehensive automated testing at each promotion gate, fail fast on quality issues
# - Manual Approvals: Require explicit approval for production promotions, implement four-eyes principle, document approva
# - Immutable Artifacts: Promote same Docker image/artifact across environments, only change configuration/secrets
