## Scope

### In Scope

- GDPR Article 35 mandatory DPIA triggers (systematic monitoring, Article 9 special categories at scale, automated decision-making per Article 22)
- Processing operation description including data categories, purposes, recipients, retention periods, and data flows
- Necessity and proportionality assessment evaluating whether processing is essential for stated purpose with minimal privacy intrusion
- Privacy risk identification covering risks to individual rights (discrimination, identity theft, unauthorized disclosure, profiling harm)
- Risk likelihood and impact assessment using privacy risk matrices (e.g., catastrophic/likely to negligible/rare scale)

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered by this artifact

## Best Practices

**Early Assessment Timing**: Conduct DPIAs at project inception before system design decisions are finalized, enabling Privacy by Design integration and cost-effective risk mitigation

**GDPR Article 35 Trigger Check**: Systematically evaluate whether processing meets mandatory DPIA triggers (systematic monitoring, Article 9 special categories at scale, Article 22 automated decisions, EDPB criteria list)

**DPO Consultation**: Seek DPO advice per GDPR Article 35(2) throughout DPIA process including assessment scoping, risk evaluation, and mitigation recommendations

**Necessity and Proportionality Analysis**: Rigorously assess whether processing is necessary for stated purpose and proportionate to privacy intrusion using data minimization principles

**Privacy Risk Matrix**: Apply consistent risk scoring methodology (e.g., likelihood Ã— impact matrix) with clear definitions of catastrophic/high/medium/low/negligible risk levels
