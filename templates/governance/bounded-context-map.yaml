It supports decisions about service boundaries, API contracts, data ownership, and organizational structure al...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Event Storming Workshops: Use collaborative Event Storming to discover bounded contexts with domain experts, developers, archi
# - Business Capability Alignment: Align bounded contexts with business capabilities; avoid technical decomposition (database, UI, API)
# - Ubiquitous Language: Ensure each bounded context has consistent vocabulary; same term may mean different things in differ
# - Single Team Ownership: Assign one team per bounded context; avoid shared ownership to maintain autonomy and reduce coordina
# - Right-Size Contexts: Balance context size - too large loses modularity benefits, too small creates integration complexity
