# PURPOSE
# This artifact defines strategic domain boundaries and integration patterns for complex systems, enabling microservices decomposition, team organization, and integration architecture design. It supports decisions about service boundaries, API contracts, data ownership, and organizational structure al

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Event Storming Workshops: Use collaborative Event Storming to discover bounded contexts with domain experts, developers, archi
# - Business Capability Alignment: Align bounded contexts with business capabilities; avoid technical decomposition (database, UI, API)
# - Ubiquitous Language: Ensure each bounded context has consistent vocabulary; same term may mean different things in differ
# - Single Team Ownership: Assign one team per bounded context; avoid shared ownership to maintain autonomy and reduce coordina
# - Right-Size Contexts: Balance context size - too large loses modularity benefits, too small creates integration complexity

# Main content - customize based on artifact type
