# PURPOSE
# This artifact defines the comprehensive caching strategy to reduce application latency from seconds to milliseconds, decrease database load by 70-95%, minimize network bandwidth consumption, and improve application scalability through intelligent multi-tier caching that balances performance optimiza

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Version Control: Store in centralized version control system (Git, SharePoint with versioning, etc.) to maintain comp
# - Multi-Tier Caching Architecture: Implement layered caching strategy (browser cache → CDN → application cache → database cache) to max
# - Cache Key Design: Use hierarchical, versioned cache keys with namespaces (e.g., `user:{userId}:profile:v2`, `product:{
# - TTL Strategy: Set appropriate TTLs based on data volatility (static content: 1 year, user sessions: 30 min, real-t
# - Cache Invalidation: Implement event-driven cache invalidation using message queues (Kafka, SQS, Redis Pub/Sub) rather th
