# Changelogs provide a comprehensive, chronological record of all notable software changes across versions using Keep a Changelog format (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security). They document version history for upgrade planning, regression analysis, security auditing, and compliance tr

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Keep a Changelog Format: Use standardized sections (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security) for consistency
# - Automate from Commits: Use conventional-changelog or semantic-release to generate from Conventional Commits
# - Chronological Ordering: List versions newest-first with ISO 8601 dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
# - Unreleased Section: Maintain [Unreleased] section at top for changes between releases
# - Semantic Versioning: Follow SemVer 2.0.0 strictly - document version bumps clearly
