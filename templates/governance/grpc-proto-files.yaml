# This artifact defines gRPC service contracts using Protocol Buffers IDL, specifying service interfaces, RPC methods, request/response message types, streaming patterns, and data structures. It enables contract-first API development, cross-language code generation, type-safe communication, and effici...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Proto3 Syntax: - **Always Use Proto3**: Use `syntax = "proto3";` at top of file
# - Field Numbering: - **Never Change Field Numbers**: Field numbers are part of wire format; changing breaks compatibili
# - Schema Evolution: - **Backward Compatibility**: New clients can read old messages
# - Message Design: - **Meaningful Names**: Use clear, descriptive message names (CreateUserRequest, not Req)
# - Field Design: - **Optional Fields**: All fields in proto3 are optional by default
