# PURPOSE
# This artifact defines comprehensive firewall rule sets to protect cloud and on-premises infrastructure by implementing least privilege access, network segmentation, micro-segmentation, and defense-in-depth security controls that prevent unauthorized access while maintaining application functionality...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Version Control: Store firewall rules as infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi) in Git for change
# - Default Deny: Implement default deny for both ingress and egress, explicitly allow only required traffic (whitelis
# - Least Privilege: Grant minimum required access, prefer specific IP/CIDR over 0.0.0.0/0, specific ports over port rang
# - Rule Documentation: Document business justification, owner, and expiration date for every firewall rule
# - Stateful Inspection: Use stateful firewalls to automatically allow return traffic for established connections
