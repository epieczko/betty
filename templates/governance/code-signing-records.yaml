# This artifact serves as authoritative documentation of code signing operations including certificate acquisition (EV, OV validation), private key protection (HSM, cloud KMS), signing workflows (automated CI/CD signing, manual signing ceremonies), timestamp authority usage (RFC 3161), and signature v...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - HSM/Hardware Token Requirement: Use FIPS 140-2 Level 2+ HSM or hardware token for EV Code Signing certificates (CA/Browser Forum req
# - Certificate Type Selection: Use EV Code Signing for public distribution (avoids SmartScreen warnings); OV acceptable for interna
# - Private Key Protection: Never extract private keys from HSM; store in Azure Key Vault, AWS KMS, or hardware HSM; implement s
# - Timestamp Always: Always timestamp signatures with RFC 3161 compliant TSA; enables signature validation after certific
# - Automated Signing: Integrate signing into CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins) with HSM/KMS; avoid manual signing processes
