# PURPOSE
# Interactive Prototypes serve as working demonstrations that validate user experience, technical feasibility, and business value for proposed data visualizations, analytics dashboards, and data-driven applications before committing to full development.

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Start with User Needs: Begin with user stories and workflow requirements before designing visualizations
# - Use Representative Data: Prototype with realistic data volumes and distributions to validate performance
# - Iterative Refinement: Plan multiple feedback cycles with increasing fidelity
# - Tool Selection: Choose prototyping tools appropriate to fidelity level and stakeholder audience
# - Interactive Elements: Include working filters, drill-downs, and navigation to test actual workflows
