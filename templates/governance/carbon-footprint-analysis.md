## Executive Summary

<!-- Provide a 2-3 paragraph overview for executive audience -->
<!-- What is this document about and why does it matter? -->

## Purpose

<!-- Quantifies organizational GHG emissions across Scope 1 (direct operations), Scope 2 (purchased electricity), and Scope 3 (value chain) following GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and ISO 14064-1:2018, e... -->

## Scope

### In Scope

- Scope 1 emissions from company-owned data centers (natural gas, diesel generators, refrigerants)
- Scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity (location-based and market-based methods per Scope 2 Guidance)
- Scope 3 Category 1
- Scope 3 Category 3
- Scope 3 Category 5

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered by this artifact

## Target Audience

### Primary Audience

- **Sustainability/ESG Teams**: Use carbon footprint data to set SBTi targets, prepare CDP/TCFD reports, and track progress toward net-zero commitments
- **Data Center Operations**: Utilize PUE, WUE metrics to optimize cooling, power distribution, and renewable energy procurement for owned facilities
- **Cloud FinOps Teams**: Analyze AWS/Google Cloud/Azure emissions data to optimize workload placement, rightsizing, and carbon-aware scheduling

## Best Practices

**Organizational Boundaries**: Apply operational control approach (GHG Protocol) consistently; document organizational boundary methodology annually per ISO 14064-1:2018 Section 5

**Data Quality Tiers**: Prioritize primary data (utility bills, fuel receipts) over secondary (industry averages); achieve 80%+ primary data coverage for Scope 1+2 per GHG Protocol quality standards

**Market-Based Scope 2**: Calculate both location-based (grid average) and market-based (contractual instruments like RECs, PPAs) methods per Scope 2 Guidance dual reporting requirement

**Scope 3 Materiality Screening**: Conduct annual materiality assessment across all 15 categories; focus detailed tracking on categories >5% total emissions per Corporate Value Chain Standard

**Emission Factors**: Use region-specific factors (IEA, EPA eGRID, DEFRA) updated annually; document factor sources and vintages for audit trail and year-over-year comparability
