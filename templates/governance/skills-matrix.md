## Executive Summary

This Skills Matrix provides a comprehensive assessment of individual and team competencies across technical skills, domain knowledge, and soft skills using the Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition (Novice â†’ Competent â†’ Proficient â†’ Expert â†’ Master). This artifact enables data-driven decisions on hiring priorities, training investments, team composition, and succession planning.

**Purpose**: Map organizational capabilities, identify skill gaps, guide talent development, and ensure business continuity through appropriate skill coverage and redundancy.

**Strategic Value**: Enables T-shaped skill development, reveals single points of failure, informs $2.5M annual L&D budget allocation, and supports strategic hiring prioritization for Q1-Q2 2025.

|-------|------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **1 - Novice** | Learning fundamentals; requires supervision and step-by-step guidance | â€¢ Follows rules rigidly<br>â€¢ Limited situational judgment<br>â€¢ Needs explicit instructions<br>â€¢ Cannot troubleshoot independently | 0-6 months exposure |
| **2 - Competent** | Working knowledge; can complete tasks independently with occasional guidance | â€¢ Applies learned concepts<br>â€¢ Handles routine situations<br>â€¢ Seeks guidance for edge cases<br>â€¢ Growing pattern recognition | 6 months - 2 years |
| **3 - Proficient** | Deep understanding; handles complex scenarios; recognized as team resource | â€¢ Solves complex problems<br>â€¢ Mentors others<br>â€¢ Adapts to new situations<br>â€¢ Strong pattern recognition | 2-5 years |
| **4 - Expert** | Authority in domain; drives architecture/strategy; creates new approaches | â€¢ Defines best practices<br>â€¢ Leads major initiatives<br>â€¢ Innovates solutions<br>â€¢ Thought leader internally | 5-10 years |
| **5 - Master** | Industry-recognized authority; shapes organizational/industry standards | â€¢ Publishes research/talks<br>â€¢ Influences industry trends<br>â€¢ Creates frameworks/methodologies<br>â€¢ External thought leader | 10+ years |

**Self-Assessment Calibration**: Team members self-assess, then managers validate and calibrate across the team to ensure consistency and avoid grade inflation.

## Appendix B: Manager Calibration Guidelines

### Calibration Meeting Agenda

1. **Review Self-Assessments** (30 min)
   - Identify discrepancies between self-ratings and manager observation
   - Discuss evidence for each rating

2. **Cross-Team Calibration** (45 min)
   - Compare ratings across teams for consistency
   - Align on what "Expert" vs "Proficient" means for each skill
   - Adjust ratings to ensure fairness

3. **Gap Analysis** (30 min)
   - Identify team-level skill gaps
   - Prioritize hiring and training needs

4. **Succession Planning** (15 min)
   - Identify high-potential individuals
   - Flag single points of failure

**Calibration Principles**:
- **Evidence-Based**: Require concrete examples for 4+ ratings
- **Avoid Inflation**: "Expert" should be rare (top 10-15% of team)
- **Growth Mindset**: Focus on development trajectory, not just current state
- **Fairness**: Apply same standards across all team members
