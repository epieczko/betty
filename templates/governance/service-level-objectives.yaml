# PURPOSE
# This artifact defines Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs) for all critical services, establishing measurable reliability targets, error budget calculations, burn rate alert thresholds, and error budget policies. It documents SLI selection criteria, SLO target percenta

# BEST PRACTICES
# - User-Centric SLIs: Define SLIs based on actual user experience (request success, page load latency) not system metrics
# - Request-Based SLI: Prefer request-based SLIs (successful requests / total requests) over time-based for accuracy
# - Achievable Targets: Start with 99% or 99.9%; avoid 100% SLOs (no error budget); four nines (99.99%) rarely justified
# - Error Budget Buffer: Set SLOs stricter than SLAs (SLO 99.9%, SLA 99.5%) to avoid SLA breaches
# - Multi-Window Alerts: Implement burn rate alerts with multiple time windows (1h fast, 6h medium, 3d slow burn)
