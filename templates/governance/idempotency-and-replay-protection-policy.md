## Executive Summary

<!-- Provide a 2-3 paragraph overview for executive audience -->
<!-- What is this document about and why does it matter? -->

## Purpose

<!-- This artifact establishes policies and implementation patterns that ensure operations are idempotent (producing the same result when executed multiple times) and protected from replay attacks. It prev... -->

## Scope

### In Scope

- Idempotency key patterns (Idempotency-Key header, request fingerprinting)
- Client-generated vs. server-generated idempotency keys
- Idempotency key storage, lifecycle, and expiration (typically 24 hours)
- Database uniqueness constraints for deduplication
- Exactly-once delivery semantics in messaging systems

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered by this artifact

## Target Audience

### Primary Audience

- Backend Engineers implementing idempotent APIs
- Platform Engineers building distributed systems infrastructure
- Site Reliability Engineers ensuring system reliability

### Secondary Audience

- Additional stakeholders who may reference this document

## [Main Section 1]

<!-- Complete this section with artifact-specific content -->
<!-- Refer to the artifact description for required structure -->

## [Main Section 2]

<!-- Add additional sections as needed -->

## Best Practices

**Always Require Idempotency Keys**: Require Idempotency-Key header for all mutating operations (POST, PATCH, non-idempotent PUT)

**Client-Generated Keys**: Prefer client-generated UUIDs for idempotency keys to survive client crashes

**UUID V4 Standard**: Use UUID v4 for idempotency keys to ensure global uniqueness

**24-Hour Window**: Store idempotency keys for 24 hours to handle delayed retries

**Store Original Response**: Cache the full response for idempotent replay, not just success/failure
