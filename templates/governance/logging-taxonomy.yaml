# PURPOSE
# This artifact standardizes log message formats, field names, log levels, and logging patterns across applications and infrastructure. It defines JSON structured logging schemas, required/optional fields (timestamp, level, message, service, trace_id), log level usage guidelines, PII redaction rules, 

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Structured JSON: Always use JSON format with consistent field names; never use plain text logs in production
# - ISO 8601 Timestamps: Use RFC3339/ISO 8601 timestamps with UTC timezone (2024-01-15T10:30:00Z)
# - Log Level Discipline: DEBUG/TRACE off in production; INFO for business events; WARN for degraded state; ERROR for failures
# - Trace Correlation: Include trace_id, span_id in all logs when request context available (OpenTelemetry auto-instrumenta
# - Required Fields: Always include: timestamp, level, service, environment, version, message, logger
