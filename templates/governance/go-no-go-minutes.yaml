# BEST PRACTICES
# - Checklist-Based Evaluation: Use standardized launch readiness checklist to ensure consistent evaluation across releases
# - Objective Criteria: Define measurable GO criteria (e.g., zero critical bugs, 80%+ code coverage, p95 latency < 200ms)
# - Stakeholder Presence: Require key decision-makers present (engineering lead, SRE lead, product director minimum)
# - Pre-Read Distribution: Distribute readiness materials 24 hours before meeting for stakeholder review
# - Time-Boxed Meeting: Limit go/no-go meeting to 60 minutes with clear agenda and decision deadline
