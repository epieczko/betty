# PURPOSE
# Documents all backup verification and restore testing activities to provide verifiable evidence of backup integrity, recovery capability, and compliance with retention policies using tools like Veeam, Commvault, Rubrik, or Veritas NetBackup.

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Verification Frequency: Test full restores monthly for critical systems, quarterly for standard systems, annually for archiv
# - 3-2-1-1-0 Rule: Maintain 3 copies on 2 media types with 1 off-site, 1 immutable/air-gapped, and 0 errors
# - Automated Validation: Use backup software built-in verification (Veeam SureBackup, Commvault IntelliSnap validation)
# - Restore Testing Rotation: Test different systems each cycle to achieve 100% coverage annually without overwhelming operations
# - RTO/RPO Measurement: Document actual recovery times vs. SLA targets; escalate gaps exceeding 20% variance
