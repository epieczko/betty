# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Verification Frequency: Test full restores monthly for critical systems, quarterly for standard systems, annually for archiv
# - 3-2-1-1-0 Rule: Maintain 3 copies on 2 media types with 1 off-site, 1 immutable/air-gapped, and 0 errors
# - Automated Validation: Use backup software built-in verification (Veeam SureBackup, Commvault IntelliSnap validation)
# - Restore Testing Rotation: Test different systems each cycle to achieve 100% coverage annually without overwhelming operations
# - RTO/RPO Measurement: Document actual recovery times vs. SLA targets; escalate gaps exceeding 20% variance
