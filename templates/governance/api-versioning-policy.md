## Best Practices

**Choose One Primary Strategy**: Standardize on URI versioning (/v1/), header versioning, or content negotiation across the organization

**Semantic Versioning Rigor**: Apply SemVer (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) consistently - MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for backward-compatible additions

**Define Breaking Changes Explicitly**: Document what constitutes a breaking change (field removal, type changes, required fields, error code changes)

**Minimum Deprecation Window**: Enforce minimum 12-month notice for version deprecations with clearly communicated sunset dates

**Overlap Period**: Support N-1 (current + previous version) concurrently during migration windows
