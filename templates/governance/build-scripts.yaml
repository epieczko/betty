# Build scripts automate the complete software build lifecycle from source code to deployable artifacts, implementing CI/CD best practices through executable code. They eliminate manual build processes, ensure consistency across environments, and enable rapid, reliable software delivery aligned with D...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Build Automation First: All builds must be fully automated; manual build steps create toil and inconsistency
# - Pipeline as Code: Store CI/CD pipeline configurations in version control alongside build scripts (GitOps)
# - Idempotency: Build scripts must produce identical artifacts when run multiple times with same inputs
# - Fail Fast: Detect and report build failures early; run fastest checks first (linting before lengthy tests)
# - Dependency Pinning: Lock dependency versions (package-lock.json, Gemfile.lock, go.sum) for reproducibility
