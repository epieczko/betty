# PURPOSE
# This artifact provides systematic analysis of incident root causes using proven methodologies (5 Whys, Fishbone, Fault Tree Analysis) to identify fundamental failures and generate actionable remediation strategies. It solves the problem of recurring incidents by moving beyond surface-level fixes to 

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Blameless Approach: Focus on system failures, not individual blame; create psychological safety for honest analysis
# - Ask Why 5 Times: Drill down from symptom to root cause; don't stop at first answer (5 Whys methodology)
# - Precise Timeline: Reconstruct incident timeline with UTC timestamps accurate to seconds/minutes
# - Multiple Causes: Recognize most incidents have multiple contributing factors; use Fishbone to map all contributors
# - Data-Driven: Support analysis with logs, metrics, traces; avoid speculation without evidence
