# PURPOSE
# This artifact documents detailed, executable disaster recovery procedures including failover steps, recovery validation, rollback procedures, and escalation paths to restore critical systems within defined RTO/RPO targets following catastrophic failures or disasters.

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Test Regularly: Conduct full DR tests at least quarterly; validate all runbook steps actually work
# - Automate Everything: Automate failover procedures wherever possible; manual steps introduce delays and errors
# - Document RTO/RPO: Clearly define and communicate RTO/RPO for each service tier; measure adherence
# - Immutable Backups: Use immutable backups to protect against ransomware and accidental deletion
# - 3-2-1-1-0 Rule: Follow 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite, 1 offline/immutable, 0 errors in backups
