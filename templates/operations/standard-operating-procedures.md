## Best Practices

**Executable Format**: Write imperative, copy-paste ready commands; include exact syntax with expected output

**Prerequisites Clear**: List all prerequisites upfront (permissions, tools, access, dependencies)

**Step Numbering**: Use numbered steps for sequential procedures; makes progress tracking easy

**Validation Steps**: Include verification commands after each step to confirm success before proceeding

**Error Handling**: Document common errors, their causes, and resolution steps

**Time Estimates**: Provide expected execution time for procedure to set expectations

**Rollback Procedures**: Document how to undo changes if procedure fails or needs reversal

**Automation Flags**: Tag manual toil-heavy SOPs as automation candidates; track automation ROI
