# PURPOSE
# This policy establishes mandatory requirements for rate limiting all organizational APIs to protect services from overload, ensure fair resource allocation, prevent abuse, and enable API monetization. It solves the challenge of balancing API availability with resource constraints by defining quota l

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Token Bucket Recommended: Use token bucket algorithm for most APIs - allows bursts while enforcing sustained rate
# - Per-Consumer Rate Limiting: Rate limit by API key, user ID, or tenant - not just by IP address
# - Multiple Time Windows: Implement rate limits at multiple granularities (per second, minute, hour, day)
# - Generous Free Tier: Provide meaningful free tier quota for developers to build and test integrations
# - Clear Documentation: Publish rate limits prominently in API documentation with examples
