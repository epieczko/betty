# PURPOSE
# This artifact defines CDN and WAF configurations to accelerate global content delivery, reduce origin server load, enhance user experience through edge caching, and protect web applications from malicious traffic, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), credential stuffing, and zero-day exploits 

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Version Control: Store in centralized version control system (Git, SharePoint with versioning, etc.) to maintain comp
# - Infrastructure as Code: Define CDN and WAF configurations using Terraform, AWS CDK, Pulumi, or CloudFormation for repeatabil
# - Edge Security First: Implement defense-in-depth with WAF as primary application protection layer before traffic reaches o
# - Caching Strategy Optimization: Configure appropriate TTL values based on content type (static assets: 1 year, API responses: second
# - OWASP Core Rule Set: Deploy OWASP ModSecurity CRS as baseline WAF ruleset, customize based on application-specific false
