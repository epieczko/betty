# PURPOSE
# This document establishes the circuit breaker configurations for all service dependencies to prevent cascading failures, enable fast failure detection, and automate recovery during partial system outages. It solves the problem of how to fail gracefully when dependencies are unavailable by defining t

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Per-Dependency Configuration: Configure circuit breaker settings independently for each external dependency
# - SLO-Driven Thresholds: Derive failure thresholds from error budgets and SLO commitments (e.g., 99.9% SLO â†’ 0.1% error thres
# - Volume Threshold: Set minimum request volume (e.g., 20 requests) before circuit evaluation to avoid false positives
# - Fast Failure: Configure open state to fail immediately without attempting calls (fail-fast principle)
# - Half-Open Testing: Use small number of test requests (3-5) in half-open state to probe recovery
