## Executive Summary

The DDoS Posture Assessments artifact provides comprehensive evaluation of an organization's defensive capabilities against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks across network, application, and infrastructure layers. This assessment systematically evaluates detection capabilities, mitigation

## Purpose

This artifact serves as the authoritative evaluation of organizational DDoS defensive capabilities, providing systematic assessment of detection, mitigation, response, and recovery controls while identifying gaps and prioritizing improvements to protect service availability against distributed denial of service attacks.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Network-layer DDoS attack surface and defensive capabilities (L3/L4)
- Application-layer DDoS protection mechanisms (L7)
- CDN and DDoS mitigation service configurations and effectiveness
- Traffic scrubbing and filtering capabilities across edge and core infrastructure
- Rate limiting, connection management, and resource protection controls

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered

## Main Content

## Best Practices

**Annual Comprehensive Assessment**: Conduct thorough annual assessments with quarterly lightweight reviews to track posture evolution

**Multi-Layer Defense Evaluation**: Assess defenses at network edge, transit providers, CDN, application layer, and origin infrastructure

**Historical Attack Analysis**: Review all DDoS incidents from the past 24 months to identify patterns and test defensive efficacy

**Tabletop Exercise Validation**: Conduct realistic tabletop exercises with all response teams to validate procedures

**Third-Party Service Review**: Evaluate effectiveness of CDN and DDoS mitigation service configurations and response capabilities

**Traffic Baseline Establishment**: Document normal traffic patterns to enable anomaly detection and attack identification

**Capacity Testing**: Validate infrastructure can handle legitimate traffic spikes without degradation

**DNS Resilience Assessment**: Test DNS infrastructure against amplification attacks and ensure distributed, redundant architecture
