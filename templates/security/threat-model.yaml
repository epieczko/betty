# PURPOSE
# The Threat Model systematically identifies security threats, attack vectors, and vulnerabilities in a system by analyzing its architecture, data flows, entry points, and trust boundaries. It enables teams to understand "what can go wrong" from an attacker's perspective and prioritize security contro...

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Methodology Selection: Choose threat modeling methodology based on system type (STRIDE for applications, PASTA for risk-cen
# - Early Integration: Conduct threat modeling during design phase when architecture changes are less costly
# - Architecture Decomposition: Create detailed data flow diagrams (DFDs) showing processes, data stores, data flows, and trust boun
# - Asset Identification: Clearly identify and classify assets (data, systems, credentials) by sensitivity and business critic
# - Threat Actor Profiling: Define realistic threat actors with specific capabilities, motivations, and resources (e.g., nation-
