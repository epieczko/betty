## Executive Summary

This RBAC/ABAC Authorization Matrix defines role-based and attribute-based access control policies across all organizational resources. The hybrid model combines traditional RBAC for predictable access patterns with ABAC for dynamic, context-aware authorization decisions based on user attributes, resource classifications, environmental conditions, and risk scores.

**Key Statistics:**
- 28 defined roles spanning administrative, engineering, data, and business functions
- 45+ protected resources including compute, storage, databases, applications
- Hybrid RBAC + ABAC model supporting Zero Trust principles
- Quarterly access certification for all privileged roles

## Access Control Models

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

Access determined by assigned roles. Users inherit all permissions associated with their role(s).

**Benefits:**
- Simple to understand and manage
- Predictable access patterns
- Aligns with org structure

**Example:**
```
User: jane.doe@company.com
Roles: [Senior_Developer, API_Developer]
â†’ Inherits: Code commit, PR approval, API deployment (non-prod)
```

### ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)

Access determined dynamically by evaluating attributes:
- **User Attributes:** Department, clearance level, location, device posture
- **Resource Attributes:** Classification, owner, environment (prod/staging/dev)
- **Environmental Attributes:** Time of day, network location, risk score

**Benefits:**
- Fine-grained control
- Context-aware decisions
- Supports Zero Trust

**Example:**
```
IF user.security_clearance == "secret" AND
   resource.classification IN ["public", "internal", "confidential"] AND
   request.network == "corporate_vpn" AND
   request.time.hour BETWEEN 6 AND 22
THEN ALLOW READ, WRITE
```

|-------------------|--------|---------------------|
| **< 30** (Low) | ALLOW | None |
| **30-70** (Medium) | ALLOW | Require step-up authentication (re-enter password or MFA) |
| **> 70** (High) | DENY | Trigger security review; user must contact security team |

**Example Scenario:**
```
User: john.doe@company.com
User Risk Score: 25 (low - normal behavior)
Resource: production_database
Resource Sensitivity: High
Request: Read customer PII
Time: 2:00 AM (unusual)
Location: New IP address (unusual)

Calculated Request Risk Score: 65 (medium)

Result: ALLOW with STEP_UP_AUTHENTICATION required
Action: User must re-authenticate with MFA before access granted
