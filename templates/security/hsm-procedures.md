## Executive Summary

The HSM Procedures artifact documents operational procedures for Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) including FIPS 140-2 Level 3 initialization, crypto officer role management, key generation and backup, firmware updates, and disaster recovery operations. This artifact provides comprehensive operation

## Purpose

This artifact serves as authoritative operational documentation for HSM lifecycle management including initialization, partitioning, crypto officer credential management, key generation and storage, backup and recovery, firmware updates, security monitoring, and decommissioning. It provides step-by-step procedures for FIPS 140-2 Level 3 operations, emergency response for HSM failures, and complian

## Scope

### In Scope

- HSM initialization and FIPS mode activation (FIPS 140-2 Level 2/3)
- Crypto Officer (CO) and Security Officer (SO) role management
- HSM partitioning and client application access controls
- Key generation within HSM (RSA, ECDSA, AES, HMAC keys)
- Key backup and cloning (HSM-to-HSM secure transfer)

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered

## Best Practices

**FIPS Mode Always**: Initialize HSMs in FIPS 140-2 mode; never operate in non-FIPS mode for production; verify FIPS validation certificate

**Dual Control**: Implement dual control for all critical operations; require minimum 2 crypto officers for key generation, backup, restore

**M-of-N Authentication**: Use M-of-N quorum authentication (e.g., 3-of-5 COs required) for high-security operations

**Partition Isolation**: Create separate HSM partitions per application/environment; isolate development, staging, production keys

**Role Separation**: Maintain strict separation between Security Officer (SO) and Crypto Officer (CO) roles; never combine roles

**Credential Security**: Store CO/SO credentials in password manager or physical safe; enforce password complexity; rotate quarterly

**Backup HSMs**: Maintain backup HSM in geographically separate facility; regularly test backup/restore procedures

**Firmware Updates**: Apply firmware updates promptly; follow vendor security advisories; test updates in non-production HSM first
