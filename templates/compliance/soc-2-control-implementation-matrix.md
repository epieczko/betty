# SOC 2 Control Implementation Matrix
<!-- See also: artifact_descriptions/soc-2-control-implementation-matrix.md for complete guidance -->
<!-- YAML version available at: soc-2-control-implementation-matrix.yaml -->

## Purpose

The SOC 2 Control Implementation Matrix maps **SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria (TSC)** to implemented controls, evidence collection procedures, testing frequency, and responsible parties. This artifact supports SOC 2 Type II audit preparation and demonstrates control effectiveness.

**SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria** (AICPA):
- **CC** (Common Criteria): Security, Availability, Confidentiality, Privacy (applies to all)
- **A1**: Availability
- **C1**: Confidentiality
- **P1**: Privacy
- **PI1**: Processing Integrity

## Control Matrix Template

### CC6.1: Logical and Physical Access Controls

**Trust Service**: Security (Common Criteria)

**Control Objective**: Restrict logical and physical access to systems and data to authorized personnel

**Control Description**:
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for all administrative access
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for application access
- Quarterly access reviews and recertification
- Just-in-time (JIT) access for production systems (max 4-hour grants)
- Physical access to data centers restricted (badge access, visitor logs)

**Control Owner**: Security Team

**Control Type**: Preventive + Detective

**Control Frequency**: Continuous (automated) + Quarterly (access reviews)

**Evidence**:
- Authentication logs showing MFA usage (100% of admin logins)
- RBAC role assignments and permissions matrix
- Quarterly access review reports with sign-offs
- JIT access request logs with approval timestamps
- Data center badge access logs

**Testing Frequency**: Quarterly (sample 25 users for access review compliance)

**Last Test Date**: 2024-Q3

**Test Result**: Pass (zero exceptions)

**Deficiencies**: None

**Remediation**: N/A

### CC7.2: System Monitoring and Security Event Logging

**Trust Service**: Security (Common Criteria)

**Control Objective**: Monitor systems and detect security events through comprehensive logging

**Control Description**:
- All security events logged to centralized SIEM (Splunk)
- Log retention: 1 year online, 7 years archived
- Real-time alerting for security anomalies
- Log attributes: timestamp, user ID, IP address, action, resource, outcome
- Tamper-proof logging (write-once, immutable storage)

**Control Owner**: Security Operations Team

**Control Type**: Detective

**Control Frequency**: Continuous

**Evidence**:
- SIEM configuration showing all log sources integrated
- Sample security event logs with required attributes
- Alert configuration for anomalous activity
- Log retention policy document
- Quarterly log review reports

**Testing Frequency**: Quarterly

**Test Result**: Pass

**Deficiencies**: 2 minor findings:
- Finding 1: Application X missing user ID in 3% of logs (remediated 2024-Q3)
- Finding 2: Log retention policy not documented in wiki (remediated 2024-Q3)

**Remediation**: Completed

### CC8.1: Change Management Process

**Trust Service**: Security (Common Criteria)

**Control Objective**: Manage changes to systems through formal approval, testing, and rollback procedures

**Control Description**:
- All production changes require Change Advisory Board (CAB) approval
- Change tickets document: what changed, who approved, testing performed, rollback plan
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline (unit, integration, security scans)
- Staged rollout: dev → staging → production
- Post-deployment verification and smoke tests

**Control Owner**: DevOps Team

**Control Type**: Preventive

**Control Frequency**: Per change (hundreds per month)

**Evidence**:
- Change tickets in Jira with approval from CAB
- CI/CD pipeline logs showing automated test results
- Deployment logs with approver signatures
- Rollback procedure documentation
- Post-deployment verification checklists

**Testing Frequency**: Quarterly (sample 25 production changes)

**Test Result**: Pass

**Deficiencies**: None

---

### A1.2: System Availability Monitoring

**Trust Service**: Availability

**Control Objective**: Monitor system availability and respond to incidents to maintain uptime SLA

**Control Description**:
- Uptime monitoring from 10+ global locations (Pingdom, 5-minute intervals)
- SLA target: 99.95% monthly uptime
- Incident response playbooks for all critical failure scenarios
- On-call engineer response time < 5 minutes
- Automated failover to backup systems in < 60 seconds

**Control Owner**: SRE Team

**Control Type**: Detective + Corrective

**Control Frequency**: Continuous

**Evidence**:
- Uptime monitoring reports (monthly SLA compliance)
- Incident response logs with timestamps
- Disaster recovery test reports (quarterly)
- Failover test results
- On-call rotation schedules

**Testing Frequency**: Quarterly

**Test Result**: Pass (99.98% uptime achieved, exceeds SLA)

---

### C1.1: Confidentiality of Sensitive Data

**Trust Service**: Confidentiality

**Control Objective**: Protect confidential data through encryption and access restrictions

**Control Description**:
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest (database, file storage)
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Customer-managed encryption keys (AWS KMS)
- PII encrypted with separate keys from application data
- Access to confidential data restricted to authorized roles only

**Control Owner**: Security Team

**Control Type**: Preventive

**Control Frequency**: Continuous

**Evidence**:
- Encryption configuration documentation
- Key management audit logs
- Data classification matrix
- Access control lists for sensitive data
- Quarterly encryption verification tests

**Testing Frequency**: Quarterly

**Test Result**: Pass
