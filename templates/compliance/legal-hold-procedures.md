## Best Practices

**Immediate Action**: Issue legal hold notices within 24-48 hours of litigation trigger to demonstrate good faith preservation

**Overcollection Preferred**: Preserve broadly initially; narrow scope later to avoid inadvertent destruction of relevant evidence

**Written Hold Notices**: Always issue written hold notices (email acceptable) with clear subject lines and acknowledgment requirements

**Custodian Acknowledgment**: Require affirmative acknowledgment from all custodians; track and escalate for non-responders

**Suspend Auto-Delete**: Immediately suspend all automated deletion policies, retention rules, and scheduled purges for in-scope data

**In-Place Holds Preferred**: Use litigation hold features (Microsoft 365, Google Vault) rather than collecting data prematurely

**Backup Tape Identification**: Identify and segregate backup tapes containing custodian data; maintain chain of custody

**Periodic Reminders**: Re-issue hold notices quarterly or when custodians change roles to reinforce preservation obligations
