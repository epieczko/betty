## Executive Summary

The Load Test Report provides comprehensive analysis of load testing execution using tools like JMeter, Gatling, k6, or Locust, documenting test configuration (concurrent users, ramp-up patterns, think times), performance metrics (response times, throughput, error rates), resource utilization, and b

## Purpose

This artifact analyzes load test execution results from JMeter, Gatling, k6, or similar tools, providing context on test configuration (user profiles, ramp-up patterns, think times), interpreting performance metrics (latency percentiles, throughput, errors), correlating application and infrastructure behavior, identifying bottlenecks, and recommending specific performance optimizations.
