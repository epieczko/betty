# PURPOSE
# This artifact provides centralized tracking of software defects including severity classification, workflow status, assignment, resolution timeline, and quality metrics to enable prioritized bug fixing, process improvement, and quality trend analysis.

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Clear Descriptions: Write defect descriptions with reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior, and impact
# - Appropriate Severity: Classify severity objectively based on impact, not emotion or urgency
# - Reproducible Steps: Include detailed steps to reproduce; non-reproducible bugs are hard to fix
# - Evidence Attached: Attach screenshots, logs, videos, stack traces to aid debugging
# - Daily Triage: Triage new defects daily to ensure timely classification and assignment
