# PURPOSE
# This artifact serves as the implementation guide for generating, signing, and verifying cryptographic provenance attestations using SLSA, in-toto, and Sigstore. It documents how to instrument CI/CD pipelines to automatically generate SLSA provenance, sign artifacts with Sigstore (Cosign), and verify...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - SLSA Level 2 Minimum: Achieve SLSA Level 2 (hosted build, signed provenance) as baseline for all production artifacts
# - Keyless Signing: Use Sigstore Fulcio keyless signing to avoid long-lived private key management burden
# - Automated Provenance: Generate SLSA provenance automatically in CI/CD; never manually create provenance
# - Builder Identity: Use OIDC identity from GitHub Actions, GitLab CI as signer identity (no service accounts with keys)
# - Transparency Logging: Record all signatures in Rekor transparency log for public accountability
