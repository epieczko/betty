# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Quality as Code: Store all quality rules in version control (Git) alongside data transformation code using Great Expe
# - DAMA Dimension Coverage: Ensure quality rules cover all six DAMA dimensions (accuracy, completeness, consistency, validity, t
# - Test Pyramid Approach: Layer tests from simple schema checks to complex business rule validations, balancing coverage and e
# - Critical Path Focus: Prioritize quality rules for business-critical fields, regulatory data elements, and downstream depe
# - Threshold Calibration: Set realistic pass/fail thresholds based on data profiling and business tolerance for quality issues
