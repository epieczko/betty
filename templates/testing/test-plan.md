## 1. Executive Summary

This Test Plan defines the comprehensive testing strategy for [Project Name], ensuring systematic validation of functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and quality standards before production deployment. Following ISTQB standards and industry best practices, this plan establishes test coverage across unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing levels while optimizing the test pyramid for efficiency and effectiveness.

**Key Objectives:**
- Validate all functional requirements meet acceptance criteria with 95%+ test coverage
- Ensure non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability) meet defined SLOs
- Achieve 80%+ code coverage through automated unit and integration tests
- Complete regression testing within 2-hour execution window in CI/CD pipeline
- Identify and mitigate defects before production deployment with <2% escape rate

**Success Criteria:**
- All P0/P1 test cases pass before release
- Code coverage >80% (unit tests), >60% (integration tests)
- Performance tests meet p95 < 500ms latency, p99 < 1000ms
- Zero critical/high severity bugs in production-ready builds
- UAT sign-off from business stakeholders

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 In Scope

**Functional Testing:**
- User authentication and authorization (OAuth 2.0, JWT, RBAC)
- Core business workflows (order processing, payment handling, inventory management)
- API endpoints (REST APIs, GraphQL queries/mutations)
- Database operations (CRUD, transactions, data integrity)
- UI components and user interactions (forms, navigation, responsive design)
- Third-party integrations (payment gateway, shipping provider, CRM)
- Error handling and validation logic

**Non-Functional Testing:**
- Performance testing (load, stress, endurance tests targeting 10,000 concurrent users)
- Security testing (OWASP Top 10, authentication/authorization, SQL injection, XSS)
- Usability testing (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, user journey validation)
- Compatibility testing (browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge; mobile: iOS 14+, Android 10+)
- Scalability testing (horizontal scaling validation, auto-scaling triggers)
- Reliability testing (error recovery, failover scenarios, data consistency)

**Test Levels:**
- Unit testing (70% of test pyramid - JUnit, Jest, pytest)
- Integration testing (20% of test pyramid - Testcontainers, API tests)
- System testing (E2E tests - Selenium, Cypress, Playwright)
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT with business stakeholders)
- Regression testing (automated suite execution on every commit)

### 2.2 Out of Scope

- Production monitoring and synthetic monitoring (covered in Observability Plan)
- Penetration testing and ethical hacking (covered in Security Assessment)
- Capacity planning and infrastructure sizing (covered in Capacity Plan)
- User training and documentation (covered in Training Plan)
- Third-party service testing (vendor responsibility, integration points validated)

## 3. Test Strategy

### 3.1 Test Pyramid Approach

Following Martin Fowler's test pyramid pattern for optimal speed and coverage:

```
        /\
       /  \  10% E2E Tests (Selenium/Cypress)
      /----\      - Critical user journeys
     /      \     - Cross-system integration
    /________\ 20% Integration Tests (API/Service)
   /          \   - Component interaction
  /            \  - Database integration
 /______________\ 70% Unit Tests (JUnit/Jest/pytest)
                  - Business logic validation
                  - Fast feedback (<5 min)
```

**Rationale:** Unit tests provide fast feedback (execution time <5 minutes), integration tests validate component interaction (execution time <30 minutes), and E2E tests verify critical user paths (execution time <2 hours). This distribution optimizes for speed while maintaining comprehensive coverage.

### 3.2 Test Types and Coverage Targets

| Test Type | Coverage Target | Execution Frequency | Tools | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|-------|----------------|
| Unit Tests | 80%+ code coverage | Every commit (pre-push hook) | JUnit 5, Jest, pytest, RSpec | Developers |
| Integration Tests | 60%+ service coverage | Every PR merge | REST Assured, Testcontainers | QA + Developers |
| API Tests | 100% critical endpoints | Every build | Postman/Newman, Karate | QA Engineers |
| E2E Tests | 100% critical paths | Daily + pre-release | Selenium WebDriver, Cypress | QA Engineers |
| Performance Tests | All user journeys | Weekly + pre-release | JMeter, k6, Gatling | Performance Engineers |
| Security Tests | OWASP Top 10 | Weekly + pre-release | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite | Security Team |
| Accessibility Tests | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance | Sprint review | axe-core, Pa11y | QA Engineers |
| Regression Tests | Top 50 user scenarios | Every release candidate | Automated test suite | QA Engineers |

### 3.3 Test Techniques

**Black-Box Testing:**
- Equivalence Partitioning: Divide input domains into valid/invalid classes (e.g., age input: <0, 0-150, >150)
- Boundary Value Analysis: Test at boundaries (e.g., min, max, just inside, just outside limits)
- Decision Table Testing: Validate complex business rule combinations (e.g., discount eligibility matrix)
- State Transition Testing: Verify valid/invalid state changes (e.g., order lifecycle: pending → confirmed → shipped → delivered)

**White-Box Testing:**
- Statement Coverage: Execute every line of code at least once (target: 80%+)
- Branch Coverage: Test all decision points (if/else, switch cases) (target: 70%+)
- Path Coverage: Validate critical execution paths through code
- Cyclomatic Complexity Analysis: Focus testing on high-complexity modules (CC >10)

**Experience-Based Testing:**
- Exploratory Testing: Session-based testing (90-minute sessions) for discovering edge cases
- Error Guessing: Leverage team experience to predict likely defect areas
- Checklist-Based Testing: Use standard checklists for repetitive validation (security, accessibility)

| **P3 - Low** | Cosmetic issues, nice-to-have improvements | Typos, color inconsistencies, minor UX improvements | Fix when convenient |

### 7.2 Defect Workflow

```
New → Triaged → In Progress → In Review → Resolved → Verified → Closed
  ↓                                                       ↓
  └─────────────── Won't Fix / Duplicate ──────────┘

                                                    Reopened
```

### 7.3 Defect Tracking

**Tool:** Jira Software

**Required Fields:**
- Defect ID (auto-generated)
- Summary (clear, concise description)
- Severity (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- Priority (Urgent/High/Medium/Low)
- Reproduction Steps (numbered list)
- Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Example Defect Report:**

```
Defect ID: BUG-1234
Summary: Checkout fails when applying discount code for new users

Severity: P1 - High
Priority: High
Environment: Chrome 96, macOS, Staging

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create new user account
2. Add product to cart (SKU: ABC-123)
3. Proceed to checkout
4. Enter discount code "NEWUSER10"
5. Click "Apply"

Expected Result:
- 10% discount applied to cart total
- Success message displayed: "Discount applied"

Actual Result:
- Error message: "Invalid discount code"
- Discount not applied
- Network request returns HTTP 500

Root Cause: New user flag not set correctly during registration, causing discount validation to fail

Fix: Update UserService.createUser() to set isNewUser flag, add integration test

Verification: Tested in QA environment, discount applies successfully for new users
```
