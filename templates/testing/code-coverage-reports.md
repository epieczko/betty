## Executive Summary

Code Coverage Reports provide quantitative analysis of test suite effectiveness by measuring which portions of source code are executed during automated testing. These reports are essential quality metrics for software engineering teams, platform engineers, and engineering leadership, enabling data-

## Purpose

Code Coverage Reports provide objective, measurable data on test suite effectiveness to support engineering quality decisions. They answer critical questions: "Are our critical code paths tested?", "What untested code presents the highest risk?", and "Is our test coverage improving or degrading over time?" These reports enable engineering managers to set evidence-based quality standards, identify 

## Scope

### In Scope

- Unit test coverage metrics (line, branch, statement, function coverage)
- Integration and end-to-end test coverage measurement
- Coverage by module, package, class, and function
- Coverage trends over time (historical analysis)
- Critical path coverage analysis (security, payments, data handling)

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered

## Best Practices

**Branch Coverage Over Line Coverage**: Prioritize branch/decision coverage over simple line coverage; 80% branch coverage is more meaningful than 95% line coverage with poor decision path testing

**Critical Path Focus**: Mandate higher coverage (90-100%) for security-critical code, payment processing, data integrity logic, authentication/authorization

**Quality Gates in CI/CD**: Block pull request merges if new code falls below threshold (e.g., 80% coverage); use tools like SonarQube quality gates, Codecov status checks

**Coverage Trending**: Track coverage trends over time; declining coverage signals technical debt accumulation; use dashboards (SonarQube, Codecov, Coveralls)

**Differential Coverage**: Focus on new/changed code coverage in PRs; legacy code may have low coverage, but new code should meet standards

**Exclude Generated Code**: Exclude auto-generated code, build artifacts, vendor libraries from coverage calculations to avoid skewed metrics

**Combine with Mutation Testing**: Use mutation testing (Pitest, Stryker, Mutmut) to validate test effectiveness; 80% coverage with weak assertions is less valuable

**Language-Specific Best Practices**: Apply language conventions (JaCoCo for Java with Jacoco Maven/Gradle plugin, Jest+Istanbul for JavaScript, pytest-cov for Python)
