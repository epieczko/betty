# PURPOSE
# This artifact documents quantitative results from performance test execution including response time percentiles (P50/P90/P95/P99), throughput measurements (RPS/TPS), error rates, resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network), and Apdex scores. It enables teams to validate application performanc
