## Executive Summary

The UAT Sign-Off Document is a formal acceptance artifact that validates software releases meet business requirements, functional specifications, and acceptance criteria before production deployment. This document provides evidence that User Acceptance Testing has been completed according to IEEE 29

## Purpose

This artifact serves as the official business acceptance record that validates software meets functional requirements, user expectations, and production readiness criteria. It provides formal authorization to proceed with production deployment, documents test completion evidence, and establishes accountability for acceptance decisions.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Acceptance criteria validation and pass/fail status
- Test case execution results with evidence (screenshots, logs, recordings)
- Requirements traceability matrix (RTM) linking business requirements to test coverage
- Defect summary with severity classification and disposition decisions
- Business scenario testing with realistic data volumes

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered

## Main Content

<!-- Provide detailed content specific to this artifact type -->
<!-- Refer to the artifact description for required sections -->

## Best Practices

**Acceptance Criteria Upfront**: Define measurable acceptance criteria during requirements gathering, not during UAT execution

**Representative Test Data**: Use production-like data volumes and realistic scenarios that reflect actual business operations

**Business User Involvement**: Ensure actual end users (not just BAs or proxy testers) participate in UAT execution

**Traceability Matrix**: Maintain complete RTM linking every requirement to test cases and execution results

**Evidence Collection**: Capture screenshots, screen recordings, and log exports for critical test scenarios as proof of execution

**Defect Triage Discipline**: Classify every defect by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) with clear disposition decisions

**No Surprises**: Conduct daily standups during UAT to surface issues early and avoid last-minute sign-off blockers

**Conditional Approval**: Allow sign-off with documented acceptance of minor defects to be fixed post-production
