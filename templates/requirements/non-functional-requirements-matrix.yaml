# PURPOSE
# This artifact serves as the authoritative specification of non-functional requirements (quality attributes) that define how the system performs its functions. It documents measurable, testable quality criteria across all ISO 25010 quality characteristics, ensuring system architecture and design inco...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Quantifiable Metrics: Specify measurable NFRs with specific numeric thresholds (e.g., "99.9% availability" vs. "highly ava
# - ISO 25010 Framework: Organize NFRs using ISO 25010 quality characteristics for completeness and standardization
# - Quality Attribute Scenarios: Use scenario format (source, stimulus, artifact, environment, response, response measure)
# - Performance Budgeting: Define performance budgets across components; allocate latency, throughput, memory targets
# - SLA Definition: Establish Service Level Agreements with clear metrics, measurement methods, and consequences
