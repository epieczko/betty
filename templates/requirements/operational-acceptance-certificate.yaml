# PURPOSE
# This artifact serves as the operational readiness gate ensuring systems entering production have complete monitoring, tested recovery procedures, validated SLOs, documented runbooks, and verified operational capabilities before SRE/Operations assumes 24/7 support responsibility. It establishes accou

# BEST PRACTICES
# - SLO-First Approach: Define measurable SLOs (e.g., 99.9% availability, p95 latency <200ms) before system launch, not afte
# - Monitoring Coverage Validation: Verify instrumentation for all critical user journeys with synthetic monitoring and real user monito
# - Runbook Walkthrough: Require operations team to successfully execute every runbook procedure before sign-off acceptance
# - Chaos Engineering: Conduct chaos experiments (e.g., pod failures, network partitions, zone outages) and verify system r
# - Load Testing at Scale: Test at 150% of projected peak load to validate performance under stress conditions
