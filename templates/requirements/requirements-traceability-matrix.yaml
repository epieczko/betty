# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Bidirectional Traceability: Maintain both forward (requirement → implementation) and backward (test → requirement) trace links
# - Unique Identifiers: Use consistent unique IDs for all traceable items (REQ-001, TC-001, US-001)
# - Tool-Based Management: Use requirements management tools (DOORS, Jama, Azure DevOps) to automate traceability
