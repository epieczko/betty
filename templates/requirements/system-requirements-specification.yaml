# PURPOSE
# This artifact serves as the comprehensive system-level requirements specification that defines system capabilities, interfaces, constraints, and quality attributes. It establishes the complete technical foundation for system architecture, design, integration, and testing, bridging business requireme...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - System-Level Thinking: Define requirements at appropriate system level; avoid premature design decisions or implementation 
# - Interface Specification: Use interface control documents (ICDs) to precisely define system boundaries and external interfaces
# - Constraints Documentation: Explicitly document all technical, regulatory, environmental, and operational constraints
# - NFR Quantification: Specify measurable non-functional requirements (e.g., "95% availability" not "highly available")
# - System Context Diagram: Include system context diagram showing system boundary and external entities/systems
