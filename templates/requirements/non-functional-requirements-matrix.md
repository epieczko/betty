## Purpose

This Non-Functional Requirements Matrix documents system-wide quality attributes using the **ISO 25010 quality model framework**. NFRs define **how** the system performs its functions rather than **what** functions it performs.

Each NFR includes:
- Specific, measurable target
- Measurement method
- Test approach
- Business justification
- Acceptance criteria

**YAML Version**: For structured data and automated processing, use `non-functional-requirements-matrix.yaml`. This markdown version provides narrative documentation for stakeholder review.

## ISO 25010 Quality Characteristics

1. **Performance Efficiency** - Response time, throughput, resource utilization
2. **Reliability** - Availability, MTBF, MTTR, fault tolerance
3. **Security** - Authentication, encryption, audit logging, vulnerability management
4. **Usability** - Accessibility, learnability, mobile responsiveness
5. **Maintainability** - Code quality, testability, documentation
6. **Portability** - Cloud independence, browser compatibility
7. **Compatibility** - API versioning, interoperability
8. **Scalability** - Horizontal and vertical scaling

## Detailed NFR Specifications

### NFR-PERF-001: API Response Time

**Description**: 95% of API requests must complete within defined latency thresholds for responsive UX

**Target**:
- Read operations: p95 < 200ms
- Write operations: p95 < 500ms
- Search operations: p95 < 300ms

**Business Justification**: Research shows 200ms response maintains engagement. Each 100ms delay reduces conversion by 7%.

**Measurement**: Application Performance Monitoring (Datadog, New Relic)

**Test Method**:
- Load testing with JMeter/k6 at production-scale traffic
- Synthetic monitoring from multiple geographic locations
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) in production

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- 95% of product catalog API calls complete in < 200ms
- 95% of user profile reads complete in < 150ms
- 95% of order creation calls complete in < 500ms
- No API call exceeds 3-second hard timeout

**Dependencies**:
- Database query optimization (N+1 queries eliminated)
- CDN for static assets
- Redis caching layer with 90%+ hit rate

---

### NFR-REL-001: Service Availability

**Description**: System uptime excluding planned maintenance

**Target**: **99.95% monthly uptime** (21.6 minutes downtime/month maximum)

**Business Impact**: Each hour of downtime costs $500K in lost revenue and brand damage

**Measurement**: External synthetic monitoring (Pingdom, UptimeRobot) from 10+ global locations, 5-minute intervals

**Test Method**:
- Chaos engineering (Chaos Monkey, Gremlin)
- Disaster recovery drills (quarterly)
- Automated failover testing (nightly in staging)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Multi-AZ deployment in 3 availability zones
- Automatic failover verified < 60 seconds
- Health check endpoints respond in < 100ms
- No single point of failure
- Zero-downtime deployment capability

**SLA**: Customer-facing SLA with service credits:
- 99.5-99.95%: 10% monthly credit
- 99.0-99.5%: 25% monthly credit
- < 99.0%: 50% monthly credit

**Exclusions**: Planned maintenance (< 4 hours/month, 7 days notice)

### NFR-SEC-001: Authentication & Authorization

**Description**: Secure authentication with MFA for sensitive operations

**Target**: 100% of administrative access requires MFA

**Compliance**: PCI DSS 8.3, SOC 2 CC6.1, NIST 800-63B

**Test Method**:
- Penetration testing (authentication bypass attempts)
- Security audit of authentication flows
- MFA effectiveness testing

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- MFA required for admin accounts (TOTP, SMS, hardware token)
- Password requirements: min 12 chars, complexity enforced
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (30-minute cooldown)
- Session timeout: 15 minutes idle (admin), 24 hours (users)
- Biometric authentication support (WebAuthn/FIDO2)

---

### NFR-USE-001: Accessibility Compliance

**Description**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance for inclusive design

**Target**: 100% compliance (zero Level A or AA violations)

**Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA, Section 508, ADA, EN 301 549

**Business Impact**: 15% of users have accessibility needs. Required for government contracts.

**Test Method**:
- Automated testing (axe DevTools, Lighthouse)
- Screen reader testing (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver)
- User testing with people with disabilities

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility (semantic HTML, ARIA labels)
- Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 for text, ≥ 3:1 for UI components
