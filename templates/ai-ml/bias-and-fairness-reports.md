## Executive Summary

The Bias and Fairness Reports provide recurring, standardized documentation of fairness metrics, demographic performance disparities, and bias mitigation efforts across ML models in production. These reports enable continuous monitoring of algorithmic fairness, detection of fairness drift, and docum

## Purpose

This artifact provides recurring, time-series documentation of fairness metrics for ML models in production, enabling trend analysis, fairness drift detection, and compliance monitoring. It supports evidence-based decision-making for model retraining, bias mitigation, and regulatory reporting.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Confusion matrix by demographic groups
- Fairlearn MetricFrame output
- AIF360 bias metrics
- Demographic parity analysis
- Equalized odds analysis

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered

## Best Practices

**Automated Report Generation**: Schedule automated fairness report generation (weekly, monthly, quarterly) from production data

**Standardized Metrics**: Use consistent fairness metrics across all models for comparability; define organizational standards

**Statistical Significance**: Report confidence intervals and p-values; avoid over-interpreting small sample size results

**Intersectional Analysis**: Always include compound protected classes (race Ã— gender); use disaggregated analysis

**Temporal Baselines**: Compare current metrics to historical baselines; identify trends and drift patterns

**Threshold Alerts**: Configure automated alerts when fairness metrics exceed organizational thresholds

**Multiple Metric Reporting**: Report multiple fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds, calibration) as they can conflict

**Confusion Matrix Required**: Always include full confusion matrix by demographic group with sample sizes
