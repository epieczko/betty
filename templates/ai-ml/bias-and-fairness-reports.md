## Best Practices

**Automated Report Generation**: Schedule automated fairness report generation (weekly, monthly, quarterly) from production data

**Standardized Metrics**: Use consistent fairness metrics across all models for comparability; define organizational standards

**Statistical Significance**: Report confidence intervals and p-values; avoid over-interpreting small sample size results

**Intersectional Analysis**: Always include compound protected classes (race Ã— gender); use disaggregated analysis

**Temporal Baselines**: Compare current metrics to historical baselines; identify trends and drift patterns
