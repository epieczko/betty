## Best Practices

**Fairness Metric Selection**: Choose metrics appropriate for use case (demographic parity for equal representation, equalized odds for equal error rates); no single metric captures all fairness definitions

**Multiple Metrics Analysis**: Evaluate multiple fairness metrics as they can be mutually exclusive; document tradeoffs between fairness and performance

**Intersectional Analysis**: Test for intersectional bias across compound protected classes (e.g., race AND gender); use disaggregated analysis

**Baseline Comparison**: Compare model fairness to baseline (random classifier, simple rules, human decision-makers); establish improvement thresholds

**Temporal Stability**: Test fairness across time periods and data cohorts; monitor for fairness drift in production
