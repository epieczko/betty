## Executive Summary

The AI Ethics and Bias Assessment is a critical deliverable for evaluating machine learning models and AI systems for fairness, equity, and ethical risks. This artifact provides structured analysis of protected attributes, demographic parity, disparate impact, and equalized odds across model predict

## Purpose

This artifact documents comprehensive bias and fairness analysis of ML models to identify, measure, and mitigate algorithmic discrimination across protected attributes (race, gender, age, disability). It supports go/no-go decisions for model deployment, regulatory compliance documentation, and ongoing fairness monitoring.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Fairness metrics analysis
- Protected attribute analysis
- Disparate impact testing
- Confusion matrix by demographic groups
- Bias detection techniques

### Out of Scope

- Items explicitly not covered

## Best Practices

**Fairness Metric Selection**: Choose metrics appropriate for use case (demographic parity for equal representation, equalized odds for equal error rates); no single metric captures all fairness definitions

**Multiple Metrics Analysis**: Evaluate multiple fairness metrics as they can be mutually exclusive; document tradeoffs between fairness and performance

**Intersectional Analysis**: Test for intersectional bias across compound protected classes (e.g., race AND gender); use disaggregated analysis

**Baseline Comparison**: Compare model fairness to baseline (random classifier, simple rules, human decision-makers); establish improvement thresholds

**Temporal Stability**: Test fairness across time periods and data cohorts; monitor for fairness drift in production

**Proxy Variable Detection**: Use correlation analysis and SHAP values to identify features that encode protected attributes indirectly

**Confusion Matrix by Group**: Always report TPR, FPR, FNR, TNR by protected class; visualize disparities with heatmaps

**80% Rule Testing**: Apply EEOC four-fifths rule to selection rates; document when adverse impact thresholds are exceeded
