# PURPOSE
# This artifact provides comprehensive safety evaluation of LLMs and GenAI systems to identify vulnerabilities, measure safety metrics, test adversarial robustness, and validate safety controls. It supports risk-based deployment decisions and defines safety monitoring requirements for production LLMs.

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Red Team Before Deployment: Conduct structured red teaming with adversarial mindset before production deployment
# - OWASP LLM Top 10 Coverage: Test for all OWASP LLM Top 10 vulnerabilities systematically
# - Automated Safety Testing: Integrate safety tests (hallucination, toxicity, injection) into CI/CD pipelines
# - Diverse Attack Vectors: Test multiple jailbreaking techniques (DAN, persona, encoding, multi-turn manipulation)
# - Quantitative Metrics: Measure hallucination rate, toxicity scores, injection success rate, not just qualitative assessment
