# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Automated Registration: Integrate model registration into CI/CD pipelines; auto-register models from MLflow, SageMaker, or V
# - Unique Model IDs: Assign globally unique identifiers (UUIDs) to each model; maintain ID consistency across environment
# - Complete Metadata: Require mandatory fields (owner, risk tier, business use case, training data) before production prom
# - Risk Classification: Apply EU AI Act risk classification framework; document classification rationale and evidence
# - Regular Reconciliation: Quarterly reconciliation between inventory and production deployments; identify shadow AI
