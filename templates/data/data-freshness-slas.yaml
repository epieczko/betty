# PURPOSE
# Data Freshness SLAs establish formal commitments for data latency, ensuring data consumers receive timely, actionable data to support business operations, analytics, and machine learning use cases. They answer critical questions: "How fresh does our revenue dashboard data need to be?", "What latency...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Tiered SLA Approach: Define 3-4 freshness tiers (Real-time <1 min, Near real-time <15 min, Hourly <1 hour, Daily <24 hour
# - Business-Driven SLAs: Tie freshness requirements to business value; 5-minute freshness is unnecessary for monthly reports
# - Percentile-Based SLAs: Use p95 or p99 latencies instead of max latency; occasional spikes shouldn't breach SLAs
# - Streaming for Critical Paths: Use Kafka/Kinesis for <5 minute SLAs; batch ETL can't reliably achieve sub-10 minute freshness
# - Incremental dbt Models: Use incremental models for large tables; full refreshes can't meet tight SLAs at scale
