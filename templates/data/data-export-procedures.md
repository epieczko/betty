## Executive Summary

The Data Export Procedures document defines the comprehensive technical, operational, and compliance requirements for exporting customer data, system data, and organizational data from applications, databases, and SaaS platforms. These procedures ensure secure, compliant, and efficient data extracti

## Purpose

This artifact serves as the authoritative reference for all data export operations, defining technical procedures, security controls, compliance requirements, and operational workflows for extracting data from organizational systems. It solves the challenge of balancing data accessibility for legitimate business needs against security, privacy, and compliance requirements by establishing standardi

## Scope

### In Scope

- Customer data portability requests under GDPR Article 20, CCPA Section 1798.100, and similar privacy regulations
- System-to-system data exports for integration, synchronization, and analytics purposes (ETL/ELT pipelines)
- Database export procedures for PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, and cloud data warehouses
- SaaS application exports from Salesforce, Workday, ServiceNow, HubSpot, and other business applications via API, bulk export, or admin consoles
- Data format specifications including CSV, JSON, XML, Parquet, Avro, Protocol Buffers, and proprietary formats

## Best Practices

**Encryption by Default**: Encrypt all exported data using AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit, with no exceptions for sensitive or PII data

**Access Control Rigor**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with principle of least privilege, requiring approval workflows for sensitive data exports

**Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Log all export activities capturing user identity, timestamp, data volume, destination, and business justification for compliance and security monitoring

**Data Validation**: Implement automated validation checks confirming export completeness, row counts, checksums, and data integrity before delivering to requesters

**Format Standardization**: Define standard export formats (CSV UTF-8, JSON, Parquet) with documented schemas preventing format inconsistency and import errors

**Incremental Exports**: Leverage incremental export strategies using change data capture (CDC) or timestamp-based filtering reducing processing time and network bandwidth

**Parallel Processing**: Implement parallel export execution for large datasets using partitioning and multi-threading improving export performance 5-10x

**Compression Standards**: Apply gzip, zip, or columnar compression (Parquet, ORC) reducing export file sizes by 60-90% for storage and transfer efficiency
