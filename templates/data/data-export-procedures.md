## Best Practices

**Encryption by Default**: Encrypt all exported data using AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit, with no exceptions for sensitive or PII data

**Access Control Rigor**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with principle of least privilege, requiring approval workflows for sensitive data exports

**Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Log all export activities capturing user identity, timestamp, data volume, destination, and business justification for compliance and security monitoring

**Data Validation**: Implement automated validation checks confirming export completeness, row counts, checksums, and data integrity before delivering to requesters

**Format Standardization**: Define standard export formats (CSV UTF-8, JSON, Parquet) with documented schemas preventing format inconsistency and import errors
