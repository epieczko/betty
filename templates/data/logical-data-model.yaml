# This artifact provides a platform-independent, business-oriented data structure specification defining entities, attributes, relationships, business rules, and constraints using normalized forms, dimensional models, or Data Vault architectures to serve as the blueprint for physical database implemen...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Business Language First: Use business terminology for entity and attribute names, avoiding technical jargon or abbreviations
# - Normalization for OLTP: Apply Third Normal Form (3NF) or Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) for transactional operational systems
# - Dimensional for Analytics: Use star schema or snowflake schema for data warehouses and analytical data marts
# - Data Vault for EDW: Consider Data Vault 2.0 (hubs, links, satellites) for enterprise data warehouses requiring historiza
# - Consistent Notation: Standardize on one ERD notation (Crow's Foot, IE, UML) across the enterprise for consistency
