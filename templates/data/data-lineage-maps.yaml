# PURPOSE
# This artifact documents the complete data flow topology from source extraction through transformation pipelines to consumption endpoints, capturing table-level and column-level lineage, transformation logic, data dependencies, and processing sequences. It enables impact analysis, debugging, complian...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Automate Lineage Capture: Implement automated lineage harvesting using OpenLineage, DataHub extractors, or Apache Atlas hooks 
# - Column-Level Granularity: Capture field-level lineage wherever possible to enable precise impact analysis and debugging of dat
# - dbt DAG Integration: Leverage dbt's built-in lineage graph generation and integrate with DataHub or Collibra for enterpri
# - OpenLineage Events: Emit OpenLineage events from Airflow, Spark, and custom pipelines to maintain real-time lineage accu
# - Bi-directional Lineage: Capture both upstream (where data comes from) and downstream (where data is used) lineage for compre
