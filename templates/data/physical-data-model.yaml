# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Workload-Driven Design: Analyze query patterns, read/write ratios, and access patterns before finalizing indexes and partiti
# - Platform-Native Features: Leverage platform-specific optimizations (Snowflake micro-partitions, BigQuery partitioned tables, P
# - Index Strategy: Create covering indexes for critical queries, avoid over-indexing writes-heavy tables, use filtered/
# - Partitioning by Access Pattern: Partition by date for time-series data, by geography for regional queries, by customer segment for m
# - Denormalization with Purpose: Denormalize only when proven performance benefits outweigh maintenance complexity; document rational
