## Best Practices

**30-90 Day SLA Tracking**: Establish clear data return timelines (30 days for GDPR erasure, 60-90 days for contractual return) with automated ticketing and escalation

**Multi-Environment Purging**: Delete customer data from production, staging, development, test, backup, DR, and analytics environments to ensure complete removal

**Backup Expiration Acceleration**: Override standard backup retention policies to force-expire customer data backups within 30-90 days vs standard 7-year retention

**Cryptographic Verification**: Generate SHA-256 hashes of returned data to enable customer verification of completeness and detect tampering

**Encrypted Transit**: Use TLS 1.3 for SFTP, HTTPS for API exports, and AWS S3 SSE-C/GCS CSEK for customer-managed encryption keys
