## Executive Summary

The Customer Data Return Procedures document defines the technical and operational processes for returning or destroying customer data upon contract termination, service migration, or regulatory request, ensuring GDPR Article 17 (Right to Erasure), CCPA deletion compliance, and contractual data retu

## Purpose

Defines technical processes and operational procedures for secure customer data return, migration, and destruction upon contract termination, ensuring 30-90 day SLA compliance, GDPR Article 17/28 obligations, and cryptographic verification of complete data removal across production, backup, and DR systems.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Structured data return (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server databases)
- Unstructured data return (S3, Azure Blob, GCS object storage)
- Backup and disaster recovery copy destruction (Veeam, Commvault, Rubrik)
- Log data purging (Splunk, ELK, Datadog, CloudWatch Logs)
- Data warehouse extraction (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Synapse)

### Out of Scope

## Best Practices

**30-90 Day SLA Tracking**: Establish clear data return timelines (30 days for GDPR erasure, 60-90 days for contractual return) with automated ticketing and escalation

**Multi-Environment Purging**: Delete customer data from production, staging, development, test, backup, DR, and analytics environments to ensure complete removal

**Backup Expiration Acceleration**: Override standard backup retention policies to force-expire customer data backups within 30-90 days vs standard 7-year retention

**Cryptographic Verification**: Generate SHA-256 hashes of returned data to enable customer verification of completeness and detect tampering

**Encrypted Transit**: Use TLS 1.3 for SFTP, HTTPS for API exports, and AWS S3 SSE-C/GCS CSEK for customer-managed encryption keys

**Format Standardization**: Provide data in industry-standard formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet, Avro) with schema documentation for easy import to new systems

**Incremental Deletion Logging**: Generate detailed audit logs showing data deletion across each system, timestamp, executor, and verification status

**NIST SP 800-88 Compliance**: Follow NIST media sanitization guidelines for Clear (logical overwrite), Purge (cryptographic erase), or Destroy (physical destruction)
