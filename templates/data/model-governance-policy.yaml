# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Risk-Based Governance: Apply governance rigor proportional to model risk; streamline approval for low-risk models
# - Clear Approval Gates: Define explicit go/no-go criteria for each approval gate; avoid subjective criteria
# - Model Risk Committee: Establish committee with cross-functional representation (data science, risk, legal, business)
# - Automated Compliance Checks: Integrate policy checks into CI/CD pipelines; prevent non-compliant deployments
# - Champion/Challenger Standard: Require statistical significance testing (p < 0.05) before replacing production models
