# PURPOSE
# This policy establishes mandatory governance requirements for all ML models and AI systems, defining approval gates, risk classification, monitoring obligations, documentation standards, and accountability structures. It ensures consistent, risk-based oversight of the AI portfolio while enabling inn

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Risk-Based Governance: Apply governance rigor proportional to model risk; streamline approval for low-risk models
# - Clear Approval Gates: Define explicit go/no-go criteria for each approval gate; avoid subjective criteria
# - Model Risk Committee: Establish committee with cross-functional representation (data science, risk, legal, business)
# - Automated Compliance Checks: Integrate policy checks into CI/CD pipelines; prevent non-compliant deployments
# - Champion/Challenger Standard: Require statistical significance testing (p < 0.05) before replacing production models
