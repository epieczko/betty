# PURPOSE
# This artifact specifies comprehensive ETL/ELT process designs including source system extraction, data transformation logic (SQL, Python, dbt models), loading patterns, data quality validations, incremental strategies, and orchestration dependencies. It enables Data Engineers and Analytics Engineers...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - ELT Over ETL: Prefer ELT pattern with transformation-in-warehouse for cloud data platforms, leverage compute scala
# - Medallion Architecture: Implement bronze (raw), silver (cleansed), gold (business) layers for clear data maturity progressio
# - Incremental Loading: Use incremental strategies (timestamp, CDC) instead of full refreshes, implement proper merge/upsert
# - dbt Best Practices: Use staging models (stg_), intermediate models (int_), marts (marts_), follow dbt style guide, imple
# - Data Quality First: Implement dbt tests for all models, use Great Expectations for complex validation, fail pipeline on
