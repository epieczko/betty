# PURPOSE
# This artifact defines the structure, semantic conventions, and standards for telemetry data (traces, metrics, logs) collected from distributed systems. It establishes consistent instrumentation patterns, attribute naming, span semantics, metric types, and log fields that enable unified observability...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Semantic Conventions: - **Follow OTel Standards**: Use OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for consistency
# - Trace Instrumentation: - **Span Naming**: Use meaningful span names describing operation (HTTP GET /users, db.query users)
# - Metrics Instrumentation: - **Metric Naming**: Use descriptive names with unit suffixes (http_requests_total, response_time_se
# - Structured Logging: - **JSON Format**: Use structured JSON logs for machine readability
# - Context Propagation: - **W3C Trace Context**: Use traceparent/tracestate headers for HTTP
