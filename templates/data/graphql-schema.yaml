# PURPOSE
# This artifact defines the GraphQL type system and API contract using Schema Definition Language (SDL). It specifies object types, queries, mutations, subscriptions, input types, interfaces, unions, enums, and custom scalars that enable clients to request exactly the data they need through a strongly...

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Schema Design Principles: - **Nullable by Default**: Make fields nullable unless absolutely required; enables schema evolution
# - Type System Best Practices: - **Use Interfaces**: Extract common fields into interfaces for polymorphic queries
# - Query Design: - **Granular Queries**: Provide specific queries instead of one generic query with many filters
# - Mutation Design: - **Single Purpose**: Each mutation should do one thing; avoid generic update mutations
# - Subscription Design: - **Event-Based**: Model subscriptions as events (orderUpdated, not getOrder)
