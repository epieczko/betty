# Model Registry Entries
# See also: artifact_descriptions/model-registry-entries.md for complete guidance

# The Model Registry Entries are structured metadata records in centralized model registries (MLflow, SageMaker Model Registry, Vertex AI Model Registry) that track model versions, deployment status, li

# PURPOSE
# This artifact documents the structure, metadata schema, and lifecycle management of model registry entries to enable standardized model versioning, deployment tracking, and governance integration. It provides technical specification for model registry implementation and usage....

# MAIN CONTENT
# Complete the sections below based on your specific artifact needs

# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Automated Registration: Automatically register models from training pipelines; avoid manual registration
# - Semantic Versioning: Use MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning; increment MAJOR for breaking changes
# - Complete Metadata: Populate all metadata fields (tags, description, hyperparameters, metrics) at registration time
# - Model Signature: Always include model signature (input/output schema) for contract enforcement
# - Immutable Versions: Never modify registered model artifacts; create new version for changes
