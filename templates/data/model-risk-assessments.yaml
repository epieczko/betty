# PURPOSE
# This artifact provides comprehensive risk assessment of ML models to classify risk tier, identify vulnerabilities, quantify potential impact, and define risk mitigation controls. It supports risk-based model governance decisions including approval, validation frequency, and monitoring requirements.

# BEST PRACTICES
# - Risk-Based Approach: Apply SR 11-7 risk classification factors (materiality, complexity, business context) consistently
# - Quantitative Analysis: Include quantitative risk metrics (VaR, expected loss, risk scores) not just qualitative assessments
# - Back-Testing Required: Always conduct back-testing on holdout data or out-of-time validation set
# - Stress Testing: Test model under adverse scenarios relevant to business context (market crash, recession, outliers)
# - Sensitivity Analysis: Identify most influential features and hyperparameters; test robustness to perturbations
