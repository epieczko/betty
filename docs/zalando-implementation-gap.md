# Zalando API Guidelines - Implementation Gap Analysis

## Current Implementation (14 rules)

### MUST Rules (5)
- ✅ MUST_001: Required x-api-id metadata (UUID)
- ✅ MUST_002: Required x-audience metadata
- ✅ MUST_003: Path naming conventions (kebab-case/snake_case)
- ✅ MUST_004: Property naming (snake_case)
- ✅ MUST_005: HTTP method usage (GET no requestBody)

### SHOULD Rules (9)
- ✅ SHOULD_001: Contact information
- ✅ SHOULD_002: POST returns 201
- ✅ SHOULD_003: Document 400 errors
- ✅ SHOULD_004: Document 500 errors
- ✅ SHOULD_005: 201 includes Location header
- ✅ SHOULD_006: Problem schema for errors
- ✅ SHOULD_007: Error responses use application/problem+json
- ✅ SHOULD_008: X-Flow-ID header for tracing
- ✅ SHOULD_009: Security schemes defined

## Missing Zalando Rules (High Priority)

### General Guidelines
- ❌ MUST follow API First Principle
- ❌ MUST provide API specification using OpenAPI
- ❌ MUST publish OpenAPI spec
- ❌ MUST use semantic versioning
- ❌ MUST use hyphenated HTTP headers (not camelCase)

### HTTP Headers
- ❌ MUST support X-Flow-ID
- ❌ SHOULD use standard headers (Content-Type, etc.)
- ❌ MAY use custom headers with X- prefix
- ❌ SHOULD use Content-Location for created resources

### JSON Guidelines
- ❌ MUST use JSON as payload data interchange format
- ❌ MUST use standard date/time formats (ISO 8601)
- ❌ MUST use standard money format
- ❌ MUST define format for Type/Extension
- ❌ SHOULD use common field names (id, created, modified)
- ❌ SHOULD pluralize array names

### HTTP Methods
- ❌ MUST use HTTP methods correctly (full semantics)
- ❌ MUST use standard HTTP status codes
- ❌ SHOULD use 207 for batch/bulk requests
- ❌ SHOULD use 429 with Retry-After for rate limiting
- ❌ MUST use PUT for full replacement
- ❌ SHOULD use PATCH for partial update

### Naming Conventions
- ❌ MUST use snake_case for query parameters
- ❌ MUST use snake_case for path parameters
- ❌ SHOULD prefer hyphenated-pascal-case for HTTP headers

### Resources
- ❌ MUST keep URLs verb-free
- ❌ MUST use URL-friendly resource identifiers
- ❌ SHOULD limit nesting to 2 levels
- ❌ MUST use plural for resource collections

### Common Data Objects
- ❌ SHOULD use common money object
- ❌ SHOULD use common address object
- ❌ SHOULD use common link object

### Pagination
- ❌ MUST support pagination
- ❌ SHOULD use cursor-based pagination
- ❌ SHOULD prefer limit/offset for simple cases

### Filtering & Sorting
- ❌ SHOULD support filtering
- ❌ SHOULD support sorting
- ❌ SHOULD use q for full-text search

### Hypermedia
- ❌ SHOULD use HATEOAS where applicable
- ❌ MUST use common link object

### Versioning
- ❌ MUST use URL versioning
- ❌ MUST use semantic versioning
- ❌ SHOULD avoid versioning when possible

### Deprecation
- ❌ MUST obtain approval for breaking changes
- ❌ MUST deprecate features gradually
- ❌ SHOULD use Sunset header for deprecation

### Performance
- ❌ SHOULD support ETag for caching
- ❌ SHOULD support partial responses (fields selection)
- ❌ SHOULD use gzip compression

### Security
- ❌ MUST secure endpoints with OAuth 2.0
- ❌ MUST define security scopes
- ❌ SHOULD use standard OAuth flows

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical (Next Implementation)
1. HTTP method semantics (PUT/PATCH/DELETE)
2. Standard HTTP status codes
3. Query parameter naming (snake_case)
4. Resource naming (plural, verb-free, max 2-level nesting)
5. Date/time format validation (ISO 8601)
6. Money format validation

### Phase 2: Important
1. Pagination support check
2. Common header validation (Content-Type, Accept)
3. ETag support check
4. Rate limiting (429 + Retry-After)
5. Versioning in URL
6. Hyphenated HTTP headers

### Phase 3: Nice-to-Have
1. HATEOAS/link objects
2. Partial responses
3. Filtering/sorting query parameters
4. Deprecation headers (Sunset, Deprecation)
5. Common data objects (money, address)

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Expand zalando_rules.py** with Phase 1 rules
2. **Add test specs** that violate new rules
3. **Update documentation** with complete rule list
4. **Consider Zally integration** (Zalando's official linter)
5. **Add rule configuration** (allow teams to customize strictness)

---

## Alternative: Integrate Zally

Instead of reimplementing all rules, we could integrate Zalando's official linter:
- **Zally**: https://github.com/zalando/zally
- Provides complete Zalando guideline checking
- Written in Kotlin, runs as service or CLI
- Would require running Zally as external dependency

**Pros**: Complete, official, maintained by Zalando
**Cons**: External dependency, requires JVM

---

## Estimated Effort

- **Phase 1 rules**: ~40 additional validation checks (~2-3 hours)
- **Phase 2 rules**: ~30 additional checks (~2 hours)
- **Phase 3 rules**: ~20 additional checks (~1-2 hours)
- **Zally integration**: ~1-2 hours + deployment complexity

**Total custom implementation**: ~5-7 hours for 90+ additional rules
**Zally integration**: ~1-2 hours but adds infrastructure complexity
