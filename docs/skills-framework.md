# Betty Skills Framework


This document defines the complete taxonomy of skills that make up the Betty Framework.  
Each skill is implemented as a Claude Code-compatible plugin and published through the Betty Marketplace once certified.

## 6. Meta & Self-Referential Skills (Betty Bootstrapping Layer)

## Notes

- Skills marked as **core** are required for any Betty-based project.
- Non-core skills can be installed independently as plugins.
- All skills will include manifests in `/skills/<name>/skill.yaml`.
- Each category will have a `README.md` describing its scope and current implementation status.

---

## Next Steps

1. Scaffold each skill folder under `/skills/`.
2. Create a minimal `skill.yaml` and `README.md` for each skill.
3. Generate `/registry/skills.json` once all skills have placeholders.
