## Architecture Highlights

### Agent Specialization

Each agent is specialized for a specific domain:
- **Domain expertise**: Embedded in agent descriptions
- **Artifact knowledge**: Knows which artifacts to produce
- **Framework awareness**: References industry standards (PMBOK, NIST, ISO, etc.)
- **Skill composition**: Uses artifact.create, artifact.validate, artifact.review

### Workflow Orchestration

Multi-artifact workflows coordinate agents:
- **Dependency management**: Ensures proper sequencing
- **Parallel execution**: Creates independent artifacts simultaneously
- **Error resilience**: Continues on individual failures
- **Comprehensive reporting**: Tracks all created artifacts

### Producer/Consumer Mapping

Complete artifact traceability:
- **Upstream dependencies**: Which artifacts feed into others
- **Downstream consumers**: Which artifacts depend on others
- **Agent capabilities**: What each agent can produce
- **Workflow definitions**: Pre-configured artifact sets

---

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Artifact
```
User Request → Agent Selection → artifact.create → artifact.validate → Artifact
```

### Pattern 2: Workflow
```
User Request → workflow.orchestrate → Multiple Agents → artifact.create (x N) → artifact.validate (x N) → Artifact Set
```

### Pattern 3: Custom Chain
```
Agent 1 → Artifact A → Agent 2 → Artifact B → Agent 3 → Artifact C
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Agent Invocation**: Agents created but direct invocation not yet implemented
   - **Workaround**: Use workflow.orchestrate or artifact.create directly

2. **Incomplete Artifact Registry**: Not all workflow artifacts registered yet
   - **Impact**: Some workflow artifacts may fail to generate
   - **Example**: project-charter, stakeholder-analysis not yet in KNOWN_ARTIFACT_TYPES

3. **Workflow Parallelization**: Currently sequential execution
   - **Future**: Parallel creation of independent artifacts

4. **Agent Intelligence**: Agents don't yet select best artifact types automatically
   - **Future**: AI-powered artifact type selection based on context

---

## Future Enhancements

   - Agent-to-agent communication
   - Dynamic skill composition

2. **Intelligent Artifact Selection**

   - Automatic dependency resolution

3. **Enhanced Workflows**

   - Workflow templates
   - Conditional execution
   - Loop detection

4. **Advanced Orchestration**
   - True parallel execution
   - Resource optimization
   - Priority-based scheduling
   - Retry mechanisms

5. **Additional Agents**
   - requirements.engineer
   - architecture.designer
   - product.manager
   - release.manager

## Migration Guide

### From Manual Artifact Creation

**Before**:
```bash
# Manually create each artifact
vim business-case.yaml  # 4-8 hours
vim threat-model.yaml   # 4-8 hours
vim test-plan.yaml      # 4-8 hours
```

**After**:
```bash
# Use workflow orchestration
python3 skills/workflow.orchestrate/workflow_orchestrate.py \
  full-sdlc \
  "Your project description" \
  ./artifacts/my-project
# <5 minutes for complete set!
```

### From Phase 1/2

Already using artifact.create? Just add workflow.orchestrate:

```bash
# Phase 1/2: One at a time
python3 skills/artifact.create/artifact_create.py business-case "..." ./out.yaml

# Phase 3: Complete sets
python3 skills/workflow.orchestrate/workflow_orchestrate.py project-initiation "..." ./artifacts/
```
