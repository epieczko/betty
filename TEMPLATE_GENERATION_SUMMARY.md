# Template Generation Summary

## Objective
Rewrite all 391 artifact templates using industry best practices and real field structures, following the example of threat-model.yaml.

## Current Status

### Completed
✅ **Infrastructure Setup**

1. **threat-model.yaml** (17.7KB) - Security
   - Full STRIDE methodology
   - DREAD and CVSS v3.1 scoring
   - MITRE ATT&CK mappings
   - Detailed threat examples with mitigations
   - Complete security controls framework

2. **runbooks.yaml** (9.9KB) - Operations
   - Alert response procedures with investigation steps
   - Routine maintenance task workflows
   - Troubleshooting guides with commands
   - Disaster recovery procedures
   - Contact and escalation matrix

### Current Template Distribution
- **Total Templates**: 790 (388 YAML + 402 Markdown)
- **Artifact Descriptions**: 391
- **Detailed Templates**: 2 (threat-model, runbooks)
- **Generic Templates**: 386+ (need enhancement)

### Template Quality Breakdown
| Size Category | Count | Status |
|--------------|-------|--------|
| Very Large (>5KB) | 2 | ✅ Industry-standard, comprehensive |
| Large (3-5KB) | 275 | ⚠️  Generic structure, needs enhancement |
| Medium (1-3KB) | 14 | ⚠️  Minimal structure |
| Small (<1KB) | 97 | ⚠️  Placeholder only |

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Templates (20-30 specialized generators)
Create specialized generators for the most critical artifact types across all categories.

### Phase 2: Category Expansion
Add specialized templates for remaining artifacts in each category, building on established patterns.

### Phase 3: Quality Enhancement
Review and enhance all templates based on:
- Industry framework alignment
- Real-world usability
- Complete field structures
- Realistic examples

## Generator Enhancement Needed

The `complete_generator.py` file needs expansion with specialized generator functions for each artifact type. Pattern:

```python
def generate_[artifact_type](name, description):
    """Generate [artifact] using [industry framework]."""
    return f'''# {title}

{metadata_block}

# Industry-specific structured content
# - Real field structures
# - Framework mappings
# - Complete examples (2-3 entries)
# - Immediately usable
'''
```

## Files Created

1. `/home/user/betty/generate_templates.py` - Category mapping (391 artifacts)
2. `/home/user/betty/complete_generator.py` - Main generator with routing (512 lines)
3. `/home/user/betty/template_generator.py` - OpenAPI/AsyncAPI templates
4. `/home/user/betty/batch_generator.py` - Batch processing framework
5. `/home/user/betty/artifacts_manifest.json` - Artifact inventory

## Next Steps

1. **Enhance Generator**: Add 50-100 specialized generator functions covering all major types
2. **Run Batch Update**: Execute complete regeneration with all new generators
3. **Quality Review**: Verify each category has proper industry-standard structures
4. **Documentation**: Update artifact descriptions with template usage examples

### Testing
- Test Pyramid (Unit > Integration > E2E)
- Given-When-Then (BDD)
- AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Coverage metrics (Line, Branch, MC/DC)

### ML
- Model Cards (Google)
- Datasheets for Datasets
- MLflow Model Registry
- LIME, SHAP (explainability)

### Compliance
- GDPR (Articles 30, 35)
- SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria

## Conclusion

✅ **Framework Complete**: All 391 templates generated with routing infrastructure
✅ **Examples Created**: 2 comprehensive, industry-standard templates (threat-model, runbooks)
⚠️  **Enhancement Needed**: 389 templates require specialized generators for full industry alignment

The foundation is solid. The next phase requires creating 50-100 specialized generator functions to properly handle all major artifact types with their respective industry frameworks and best practices.
