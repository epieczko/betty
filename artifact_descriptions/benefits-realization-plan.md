# Name: benefits-realization-plan

## Executive Summary

The Benefits Realization Plan is a portfolio and program governance artifact that defines expected business outcomes, quantifiable benefits, success metrics, and tracking mechanisms for initiatives and investments. This plan connects project and program delivery to business value realization, ensuring that technical implementations translate into measurable business improvements, ROI achievement, and strategic objective fulfillment.

As a foundational portfolio management deliverable aligned with PMI benefits management and SAFe Lean Portfolio Management, it specifies quantifiable benefits (cost savings, revenue growth, efficiency gains, customer satisfaction), establishes baseline metrics and target KPIs with measurement cadence, defines benefit ownership and accountability (who realizes each benefit), and creates tracking dashboards for ongoing monitoring. The plan enables data-driven portfolio decisions by demonstrating value delivery, justifying continued investment, and identifying underperforming initiatives requiring intervention or termination.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities directly support organizational objectives and expected outcomes
- **Resource Optimization**: Enables efficient allocation of personnel, budget, and technology resources
- **Risk Management**: Identifies potential obstacles and defines proactive mitigation strategies
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Creates shared understanding of approach, timeline, and expectations
- **Success Measurement**: Establishes clear metrics and criteria for evaluating outcomes

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact defines the expected business value and outcomes from program and portfolio investments, establishing measurable success criteria and tracking mechanisms to ensure benefits are realized post-implementation. It solves the problem of disconnected delivery from business value, enabling portfolio governance to make data-driven investment decisions and course corrections.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Quantifiable benefits identification and categorization (financial, operational, customer, strategic)
- Baseline metrics and current-state measurements (before implementation)
- Target benefits and KPI goals with timelines (expected improvement and when)
- Benefit realization timeline (during implementation, at go-live, post-implementation)
- Benefits measurement methodology and data sources (how benefits will be tracked)
- Benefit ownership and accountability (who owns each benefit realization)
- Benefit dependencies on deliverables and adoption (what must be completed to realize benefits)
- Tracking dashboards and reporting cadence (monthly, quarterly benefit reviews)
- Benefits risk assessment (risks to benefit realization, mitigation plans)
- Return on Investment (ROI) calculations and payback period projections
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis and cost-benefit comparisons
- Leading and lagging indicators for benefit tracking

**Out of Scope**:
- Detailed project schedules and sprint planning (covered in delivery plans)
- Technical implementation details and architecture decisions
- Change management and training plans (separate artifacts, though inputs to benefit realization)
- Individual performance metrics and team productivity measurements
- Strategic business case and investment approval (covered in business case)

### Target Audience

**Primary Audience**:
- Portfolio Managers who track value delivery across initiatives
- Program Managers who ensure programs deliver expected benefits
- Business Owners who own benefit realization post-implementation
- Finance teams who track ROI and financial benefits

**Secondary Audience**:
- Executive sponsors who approve investments and expect returns
- Product Managers who tie features to business outcomes
- PMO teams who monitor benefits across the portfolio
- Business stakeholders who receive dashboards on benefit realization
- Delivery teams who understand the "why" behind their work
