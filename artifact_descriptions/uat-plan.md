# Name: uat-plan

## Executive Summary

The UAT Plan is a comprehensive quality assurance artifact that defines user acceptance testing strategies, test scenarios, acceptance criteria, and validation procedures to ensure software meets business requirements and user expectations before production release. This plan bridges the gap between technical testing and business validation by engaging actual end users in structured testing scenarios that validate functionality, usability, and business value.

As a foundational QA deliverable, it defines UAT scope and objectives, identifies user representatives and stakeholder participants, establishes test scenarios aligned to business processes, and documents acceptance criteria that must be satisfied for production approval. The plan integrates test management tools (TestRail, qTest, Zephyr) for test case management, defect tracking workflows, and UAT sign-off procedures that gate production deployments.

### Strategic Importance

- **Business Validation**: Confirms software meets actual business needs and user workflows, not just technical specs
- **Production Readiness**: Provides business stakeholder confidence and formal sign-off for production release
- **Defect Discovery**: Identifies usability issues, workflow gaps, and integration problems before user impact
- **Requirement Validation**: Verifies features satisfy original business requirements and acceptance criteria
- **User Experience Quality**: Ensures software is intuitive, efficient, and meets user expectations

## Purpose & Scope

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
