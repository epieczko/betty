# Name: post-implementation-review

## Executive Summary

The Post-Implementation Review (PIR) is a comprehensive retrospective artifact that evaluates initiative outcomes against original objectives, capturing lessons learned, benefits realization, and improvement opportunities. Drawing from Agile retrospective methodologies (Scrum Guide, SAFe, Liberating Structures) and benefits management frameworks, this review compares actual results versus projected outcomes from the original business case, feasibility study, and financial models (ROI actual vs. projected).

Modern PIRs leverage collaborative formats including Agile retrospective techniques (Start/Stop/Continue, 4Ls, Sailboat, Mad/Sad/Glad), facilitation platforms (Miro, Mural, Metro Retro), and structured frameworks for capturing what worked, what didn't, and what to do differently. The review serves executive leadership, program managers, and portfolio management by enabling data-driven continuous improvement, validating investment decisions, and building organizational learning. It directly feeds into knowledge management systems and influences future initiative planning.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

The Post-Implementation Review evaluates initiative success against original objectives, captures lessons learned, assesses benefits realization, and identifies improvements for future initiatives. It answers: Did we achieve what we set out to do? What was the actual ROI vs. projected? What worked well? What should we improve? What knowledge should we preserve? The review enables continuous improvement and validates investment decision-making quality.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
