# Name: remediation-tracker

## Executive Summary

The Remediation Tracker is a critical vulnerability and compliance gap management artifact that provides systematic tracking of security findings, audit exceptions, and control deficiencies through to resolution. Organizations using integrated GRC platforms like Vanta, Drata, Secureframe, or dedicated remediation tools like Jira/ServiceNow can achieve 50-60% faster remediation cycles through automated SLA monitoring, escalation workflows, and evidence collection that ensures timely resolution of security and compliance findings.

This operational artifact establishes remediation workflows, risk-based prioritization using CVSS scoring, SLA management (Critical: 7-15 days, High: 30 days, Medium: 90 days), and audit-ready tracking of all findings through to verified closure. The tracker supports SOC 2 corrective action requirements, ISO 27001 nonconformity management, PCI-DSS vulnerability remediation (ASV scans, penetration testing), and GDPR breach remediationâ€”reducing mean time to remediation (MTTR) by 40-50% while maintaining complete audit trails for compliance validation.

### Strategic Importance

- **Risk Reduction**: Systematically eliminates security vulnerabilities and compliance gaps with risk-based prioritization and automated SLA enforcement
- **Audit Excellence**: Provides comprehensive evidence of timely remediation for SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS audits with 100% finding closure documentation
- **Compliance Velocity**: Accelerates certification readiness through structured gap closure with executive visibility into overdue remediations
- **Tool Integration**: Connects vulnerability scanners (Tenable, Qualys, Rapid7), GRC platforms (Vanta, Drata), and ticketing systems (Jira, ServiceNow) for unified remediation tracking
- **Metrics-Driven**: Enables data-driven security program management through MTTR tracking, SLA compliance rates, and remediation velocity dashboards

## Purpose & Scope

## Best Practices

**Document Management**:
- **Centralized Tracking**: Maintain single source of truth in GRC platform or ITSM tool vs. disparate spreadsheets across teams
- **Real-Time Updates**: Configure automated sync from vulnerability scanners and penetration testing tools for real-time finding ingestion
- **Version Control**: For spreadsheet-based trackers, maintain version history in SharePoint/Confluence with clear change documentation
- **Access Controls**: Limit vulnerability detail access to security team, restrict read-only access for auditors and management dashboards
- **Audit Trail**: Enable full activity logging showing all status changes, assignments, and SLA modifications with timestamps and user attribution

**Remediation Workflow & Prioritization**:
- **CVSS-Based Prioritization**: Auto-assign remediation priority based on CVSS score (9.0-10.0: Critical, 7.0-8.9: High, 4.0-6.9: Medium, 0.1-3.9: Low)
- **KEV Integration**: Escalate CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities to Critical priority with 7-day remediation SLA regardless of CVSS score
- **EPSS Scoring**: Incorporate Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) for dynamic risk assessment beyond static CVSS scores
- **Business Context**: Factor asset criticality, data classification, and internet exposure into prioritization decisions
- **Risk-Based SLAs**: Critical: 7-15 days, High: 30 days, Medium: 90 days, Low: 180 days with executive approval for extensions

**Integration & Automation**:
- **Vulnerability Scanner Integration**: Auto-create tickets from Tenable.io, Qualys VMDR, Rapid7 InsightVM, Wiz, Snyk with bi-directional sync
- **Jira/ServiceNow Workflows**: Map remediation statuses to ticket workflows with automatic SLA countdown and escalation rules
- **Slack/Teams Notifications**: Configure real-time alerts for new Critical/High findings, approaching SLA deadlines, and overdue remediations
- **GitHub/GitLab Integration**: Link code commits and pull requests to remediation tickets for automatic status updates upon merge
- **GRC Platform Sync**: Bi-directional integration with Vanta, Drata, Secureframe to auto-close findings when controls pass automated testing

**SLA Management & Escalation**:
- **Automated SLA Monitoring**: Configure daily SLA calculations with color-coded status (Green: >50% time remaining, Yellow: 25-50%, Red: <25%, Black: Overdue)
- **Progressive Escalation**: 75% SLA consumed: notify assignee, 90%: escalate to manager, 100%: escalate to director, 110%: executive escalation
- **SLA Pause Mechanism**: Allow temporary SLA pauses for vendor dependency, pending risk acceptance, or legitimate blockers with approval and documentation
- **SLA Compliance Metrics**: Track SLA attainment rates by priority (target: 95% Critical, 90% High, 85% Medium) and team for performance management
- **Exception Management**: Document all SLA extensions with business justification, compensating controls, and executive approval in audit trail

**Evidence & Validation**:
- **Remediation Evidence**: Require proof of fix before closure (re-scan results showing vulnerability absent, code review approval, configuration screenshots)
- **Independent Validation**: Critical/High findings require independent security team validation vs. developer self-attestation
- **Re-Scan Integration**: Auto-trigger vulnerability re-scans 24-48 hours post-claimed remediation to confirm fix effectiveness
- **False Positive Management**: Track false positive rate by scanner/test, document false positive justifications with screenshots/evidence
- **Audit Evidence Pack**: Maintain remediation evidence for 7 years including original finding, remediation evidence, validation proof, and closure approvals

**Metrics & Reporting**:
- **MTTR Tracking**: Calculate mean time to remediation by severity and trend monthly (target: Critical <10 days, High <25 days)
- **Open Finding Aging**: Report all findings by age brackets (0-30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, 90+ days) with ownership assignment
- **SLA Performance**: Calculate SLA attainment % by team and severity for quarterly security metrics reviews
- **Velocity Metrics**: Track remediation velocity (findings closed per week/month) and net new finding rate to assess program effectiveness
- **Executive Dashboard**: Provide real-time executive view of critical/high overdue findings, top CVEs, and remediation trends

**Risk Acceptance**:
- **Formal Risk Acceptance Process**: Critical/High findings requiring risk acceptance must have business justification, compensating controls, and CISO/CRO approval
- **Time-Bound Acceptance**: Risk acceptances expire (max 12 months) and require annual re-review vs. indefinite acceptance
- **Compensating Controls**: Document compensating controls for risk accepted findings with validation evidence
- **Risk Register Integration**: Track risk accepted findings in enterprise risk register with regular executive review
- **Annual Re-Assessment**: Re-evaluate all risk acceptances annually or when threat landscape changes significantly

**Vulnerability Management Best Practices**:
- **Continuous Scanning**: Run authenticated scans weekly for critical assets, monthly for all systems vs. quarterly point-in-time scans
- **Penetration Testing Remediation**: Track pentest findings separately with required retest upon claim of remediation to validate fixes
- **Patch Management Integration**: Link vulnerability findings to patch management system for coordinated remediation and deployment tracking
- **Container & Cloud Security**: Integrate container scanning (Snyk, Aqua, Prisma Cloud) and CSPM findings into unified remediation workflow
- **Zero-Day Response**: Establish expedited workflow for zero-day vulnerabilities with <24 hour triage and <48 hour remediation for affected critical systems

**Compliance-Specific Requirements**:
- **SOC 2**: Document corrective actions for all audit findings with target completion dates and actual closure dates for Management's Response letter
- **ISO 27001**: Track nonconformities and opportunities for improvement with root cause analysis and corrective action plans
- **PCI-DSS**: Remediate all ASV scan failures within 30 days (critical), maintain quarterly remediation evidence for QSA audits
- **HIPAA**: Remediate identified security vulnerabilities affecting PHI systems with documented risk analysis and mitigation timeline
