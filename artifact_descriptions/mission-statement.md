# Name: mission-statement

## Executive Summary

The Mission Statement is a foundational strategic artifact that articulates the organization's or team's purpose, vision, values, and strategic direction, providing the North Star that guides decision-making, prioritization, and cultural norms. This concise yet powerful document defines why the organization exists (mission), where it aspires to go (vision), how it operates (values), and the strategic pillars that guide execution, creating alignment across Engineering, Product, and Business stakeholders around shared purpose and direction.

Grounded in strategic frameworks including Vision-Mission-Values hierarchies, North Star metrics, Jobs-to-be-Done customer outcomes, and strategic pillar definition, this artifact transforms abstract purpose into actionable strategy. It connects daily work to larger purpose through clear articulation of customer value delivered (North Star), guiding principles for decision-making (values), and strategic focus areas (pillars), enabling autonomous teams to make aligned decisions while maintaining organizational coherence and cultural identity.
