# Name: storyboards

## Executive Summary

Storyboards are visual narratives that map user journeys through product experiences, illustrating the sequence of interactions, emotional states, pain points, and moments of delight from the user's perspective. This artifact applies user journey mapping methodologies, service design blueprinting, and scenario-based design to solve the problem of designing features in isolation without understanding the broader context of how, when, and why users will engage with them.

Drawing on techniques from UX research (Nielsen Norman Group journey mapping), service design (Adaptive Path service blueprints), and Jobs-to-be-Done frameworks, storyboards visualize the complete user experience—from initial trigger through task completion—revealing friction points, missing features, and opportunities for innovation that static wireframes miss. Created using tools like Figma, Miro, Sketch, or specialized storyboarding platforms, they serve UX Designers, Product Managers, User Researchers, and cross-functional teams who need a shared understanding of user context to design solutions that fit seamlessly into users' lives and workflows.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

Storyboards create empathy and alignment by making user journeys visible and tangible, enabling teams to identify gaps between current and desired experiences before investing in detailed design or development. They solve the "feature factory" problem where teams build requested features without understanding the user's full journey, supporting strategic decisions about where to focus effort, what problems to solve first, and how different features connect across the experience.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- User journey storyboards (current state "as-is" and future state "to-be")
- Scenario-based storyboards for specific use cases and personas
- Wireflow diagrams combining wireframes with user flow arrows
- Service blueprints showing frontstage (user-visible) and backstage (system) actions
- Emotional journey maps with sentiment tracking across touchpoints
- Day-in-the-life scenarios illustrating context of use
- Multi-channel journey visualization (web, mobile, in-person, phone)
- Trigger-action-outcome sequences
- Pain point and opportunity identification
- Persona-based scenario variations
- Touchpoint inventory and interaction mapping
- Moments that matter (critical decision/emotion points)
- Alternative path scenarios (happy path, error states, edge cases)

**Out of Scope**:
- Detailed UI wireframes and mockups (covered by design specifications)
- Technical architecture and system diagrams (covered by technical docs)
- Quantitative user analytics and metrics (covered by analytics reports)
- Detailed user research findings and reports (covered by research deliverables)
- Implementation specifications and acceptance criteria (covered by user stories)

## Best Practices

**Ground in Research**: Base storyboards on actual user research—interviews, contextual inquiry, diary studies—not assumptions; fiction masquerading as user journey wastes everyone's time
**Specific Persona Context**: Start each storyboard with specific persona, trigger event, and goal; "A user wants to..." is too vague; "Sarah, a project manager with 3 active projects, receives urgent client request while commuting..." provides context
**Show Emotional Arc**: Track user's emotional state throughout journey—anticipation, confusion, frustration, relief, delight; emotions reveal where experience succeeds or fails
**Include Environmental Context**: Show where user is (home office, coffee shop, subway), what else they're doing, time pressure, distractions; context shapes design requirements
**Identify Pain Points Explicitly**: Mark friction moments—where user gets stuck, confused, frustrated, or abandons; these are your design opportunities
**Capture Actual Quotes**: Include real user quotes from research to bring journey to life; "I had no idea what to click next" is more powerful than "User was confused"
**Map All Touchpoints**: Show complete journey across channels—mobile app, website, email, phone support, in-person; handoffs between channels are common failure points
**Current vs. Future State**: Create "as-is" storyboard showing problems in existing experience, then "to-be" storyboard illustrating your proposed solution
**Collaborative Creation**: Run storyboarding workshops with cross-functional teams; collective creation builds shared understanding and buy-in
**Low-Fidelity for Speed**: Sketch-quality storyboards work better than polished illustrations for early exploration; don't over-invest before validation
**Sequential Panel Format**: Use comic-strip format with numbered panels showing progression; this makes sequence clear and easy to follow
**Annotation Layers**: Include annotations explaining user thoughts, system actions, pain points, opportunities; visual alone may miss important context
**Alternative Paths**: Show happy path but also document error states, edge cases, alternate routes; real users rarely follow ideal path
**Time Indicators**: Show how long each step takes; "3-minute task" that takes 15 minutes in reality reveals usability problems
**Backend Visibility**: For service blueprints, show what happens behind scenes—system processes, staff actions, business rules—that user doesn't see but experiences consequences of
**Moments That Matter**: Highlight critical decision points, emotional peaks, trust-building moments; these disproportionately impact overall experience
**Multi-Device Scenarios**: Show device switching ("start on mobile, finish on desktop"); many journeys span multiple devices
**Integration Points**: Identify where your product connects to other tools, services, or systems; integration friction is common pain point
**Test with Users**: Validate storyboards with actual users—"Does this reflect your experience?"—to catch assumption gaps
**Living Document**: Update storyboards as you learn from research, analytics, and user feedback; static storyboard becomes obsolete quickly
**Shareable Format**: Export as PDF or embed in documentation tools (Confluence, Notion) for easy sharing; Figma-only access limits audience
**Scale Appropriately**: Quick 3-panel storyboard works for simple feature; complex cross-channel journey may need 20+ panels or swim-lane blueprint
**Link to Metrics**: Connect journey stages to quantitative data—dropoff rates, time on task, support tickets—to prioritize improvement areas
**Competitive Comparison**: Map competitor journeys alongside yours to identify differentiation opportunities and gaps
