# Name: budget-forecast

## Executive Summary

The Budget Forecast is a comprehensive financial planning document that projects multi-year operating and capital expenditures (OpEx/CapEx), incorporating activity-based costing, zero-based budgeting principles, and driver-based forecasting models. This artifact leverages financial planning tools including cloud cost management platforms (AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management, Google Cloud Billing), ERP budgeting modules (SAP, Oracle Financials, Workday), and FP&A (Financial Planning & Analysis) software to provide rolling forecasts with variance analysis and scenario planning capabilities.

As a foundational component of financial governance and portfolio planning, this artifact supports CFOs, Finance Teams, Program Management Offices, and Business Unit Leaders in resource allocation, cost optimization, and financial performance management. The forecast integrates T-shirt sizing for project estimates, consumption-based pricing models for cloud services, full-time equivalent (FTE) planning, vendor contract commitments, and contingency reserves. It enables proactive financial management through budget-vs-actual tracking, burn rate analysis, and early warning indicators for budget overruns.
