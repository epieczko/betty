# Name: api-versioning-policy

## Executive Summary

The API Versioning Policy is a formal governance directive that establishes mandatory standards for API evolution, backward compatibility, and deprecation management across all REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and event-driven APIs. This policy defines the organization's approach to versioning strategies (URI versioning, header versioning, content negotiation), semantic versioning practices (SemVer 2.0.0), breaking vs. non-breaking changes, and consumer migration timelines.

As a cornerstone of API governance, this policy ensures predictable API evolution while balancing innovation velocity with consumer stability. It mandates versioning implementation across API gateways (Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway, Azure APIM), establishes deprecation windows (typically 12-18 months), defines breaking change approval processes, and specifies communication protocols for API consumers. The policy integrates with OpenAPI specifications, API catalogs, developer portals, and change management processes.

### Strategic Importance

- **Consumer Protection**: Prevents breaking changes from disrupting integrations through clear versioning contracts
- **Innovation Enablement**: Allows API evolution without blocking new features or improvements
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains support for existing consumers during transition periods
- **Developer Experience**: Provides predictable upgrade paths and clear migration guidance
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces integration failures through controlled, communicated changes
- **Governance & Compliance**: Ensures consistent versioning practices across the enterprise API portfolio

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This policy establishes mandatory requirements for versioning all organizational APIs, ensuring consistent evolution practices, protecting API consumers from unexpected breaking changes, and enabling controlled deprecation of legacy API versions. It solves the challenge of balancing rapid API innovation with stability commitments by defining clear rules for version numbering, breaking change management, backward compatibility windows, and consumer communication.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Versioning strategies: URI versioning (/v1/, /v2/), header versioning (Accept-Version), query parameter versioning
- Semantic versioning (SemVer) application to APIs: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH conventions
- Breaking vs. non-breaking change definitions and approval workflows
- Deprecation policy: notice periods, sunset schedules, end-of-life timelines
- Version support windows: how long versions remain supported
- API gateway version routing configurations (Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway, Azure APIM)
- OpenAPI specification version documentation (info.version field)
- GraphQL schema versioning and deprecation directives (@deprecated)
- gRPC/Protobuf versioning strategies and compatibility rules
- Event schema versioning for Kafka, RabbitMQ, EventBridge
- Consumer notification requirements for version changes
- Migration support: overlap periods, dual-running versions, migration guides

**Out of Scope**:
- Application version numbering (covered in release management policy)
- Database schema versioning (covered in data management standards)
- Infrastructure versioning (covered in platform standards)
- Source code version control practices (covered in development standards)
- Microservice deployment versioning (covered in DevOps procedures)

### Main Content Sections

(Content structure will vary based on specific artifact type. Include all relevant sections needed to fully document the subject matter.)

**Core Information**:
- Document the primary information this artifact is meant to capture

- Include sufficient detail for intended audience
- Provide examples where helpful

**Supporting Information**:
- Background context necessary for understanding
- Assumptions and constraints
- Dependencies on other artifacts or systems
- Related information and cross-references


## Best Practices

**Choose One Primary Strategy**: Standardize on URI versioning (/v1/), header versioning, or content negotiation across the organization
**Semantic Versioning Rigor**: Apply SemVer (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) consistently - MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for backward-compatible additions
**Define Breaking Changes Explicitly**: Document what constitutes a breaking change (field removal, type changes, required fields, error code changes)
**Minimum Deprecation Window**: Enforce minimum 12-month notice for version deprecations with clearly communicated sunset dates
**Overlap Period**: Support N-1 (current + previous version) concurrently during migration windows
**Automated Breaking Change Detection**: Integrate openapi-diff, Spectral, or buf breaking into CI/CD pipelines
**OpenAPI Version Metadata**: Document version in OpenAPI info.version and track breaking changes in changelog
**Consumer Notifications**: Require 90-day, 60-day, and 30-day deprecation notices via email, developer portal, and API responses
**In-API Deprecation Signals**: Return Sunset and Deprecation HTTP headers in API responses for deprecated versions
**Migration Guides**: Provide comprehensive migration documentation with code examples for version transitions
**Version Support Matrix**: Publish and maintain version support status (active, deprecated, sunset) in API catalog
**Backward Compatibility First**: Default to additive changes; require architecture review approval for breaking changes
**GraphQL Field Deprecation**: Use @deprecated directive with reason and replacement field guidance
**Protobuf Compatibility Rules**: Follow protobuf field numbering rules and reserved fields for gRPC versioning
**Event Schema Evolution**: Version event schemas (Kafka, EventBridge) with compatibility modes (BACKWARD, FORWARD, FULL)
**Version in URL Path**: For URI versioning, use /v{major}/ pattern (e.g., /v1/, /v2/) not /api/v1.2/
**Header Versioning Format**: Use Accept-Version: v1 or custom headers consistently across all APIs
**Test Coverage**: Require contract tests validating version compatibility before production deployment
**Monitoring & Analytics**: Track version adoption rates to inform deprecation timing decisions
**Emergency Breaking Change Process**: Define expedited approval process for critical security fixes requiring breaking changes

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
