# Name: risk-appetite-statement

## Executive Summary

The Risk Appetite Statement is a Board-approved governance document that defines the organization's willingness to accept risk in pursuit of strategic objectives, establishing quantitative thresholds and qualitative boundaries across risk categories aligned to COSO ERM and ISO 31000 frameworks. This foundational artifact guides risk-based decision making throughout the enterprise by setting clear risk tolerance levels for strategic, financial, operational, compliance, cyber security, and reputational risk domains.

As the cornerstone of enterprise risk management, this artifact enables the Board of Directors, C-suite executives, Risk Committees, and business leaders to make consistent, risk-informed decisions by providing specific risk tolerance thresholds (quantitative metrics), risk capacity limits (maximum exposure), and risk appetite ranges (acceptable variation). It integrates with GRC platforms like ServiceNow GRC, RSA Archer, or MetricStream to enable automated risk appetite monitoring, tolerance breach alerting, and Board-level risk appetite dashboards.

### Strategic Importance

- **Board Governance**: Provides Board-approved mandate defining acceptable risk-taking aligned to strategic plan, capital allocation, and stakeholder expectations
- **Quantitative Thresholds**: Establishes measurable risk tolerance levels using metrics like maximum loss tolerance, Value at Risk (VaR), capital at risk percentages, and FAIR-based loss expectancy ranges
- **Risk Category Boundaries**: Defines specific appetite levels across strategic, operational, financial, compliance, cyber, third-party, and reputational risk categories with differentiated thresholds
- **Decision Framework**: Enables consistent risk-based decisions by providing clear guidance on when risks require escalation, mitigation, or Board approval
- **Strategic Alignment**: Links risk appetite to strategic objectives, ensuring risk-taking supports business goals while remaining within Board-approved boundaries
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Satisfies regulatory expectations for risk appetite frameworks (Basel III, Solvency II, OCC guidance, COSO ERM principles)
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Guides capital allocation and resource prioritization by balancing risk and return within appetite constraints

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact serves as the Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement defining the organization's willingness to accept risk across strategic, operational, financial, compliance, cyber, third-party, and reputational risk categories.

**Green/Yellow/Red Zones**: Use traffic light approach to define acceptable (green), caution (yellow), and unacceptable (red) risk zones
**Linkage to Strategy**: Explicitly connect risk appetite to strategic objectives, capital allocation priorities, and competitive positioning
**Monitoring Dashboard**: Implement real-time or quarterly risk appetite dashboard tracking actuals vs. thresholds across all categories

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
