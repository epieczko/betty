# Name: cab-approvals

## Executive Summary

The CAB (Change Advisory Board) Approvals artifact documents formal change authorization decisions following ITIL 4 Change Enablement practices. The CAB evaluates change requests, assesses deployment risk, reviews release certification evidence, and approves/rejects production deployments based on risk classification (standard, normal, emergency). CAB approvals provide governance oversight, stakeholder alignment, and compliance audit trails for change management processes.

CAB approvals integrate with ITIL 4 Change Enablement, ServiceNow Change Management, Jira Service Management workflows, and release risk assessments. They document change classification, voting records, approval conditions, change window assignments, and rollback authorization. CAB meetings review release certification evidence, risk assessments, stakeholder readiness, and operational impact before authorizing production changes. This artifact provides SOC 2, ISO 27001, and regulatory compliance evidence for change control processes.

### Strategic Importance

- **Change Governance**: Provides formal oversight for production changes following ITIL 4 Change Enablement framework
- **Risk-Based Approval**: Evaluates change requests using risk classification (standard, normal, emergency) and voting thresholds
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensures engineering, operations, security, product, and business alignment before deployments
- **Change Window Management**: Coordinates approved maintenance windows and deployment timing across teams
- **Compliance Evidence**: Documents change control audit trail for SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI-DSS requirements
- **Emergency Change Process**: Defines expedited approval workflows for high-urgency production changes
- **Rollback Authorization**: Pre-authorizes rollback procedures and decision-making authority for failed deployments

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

CAB approvals document formal authorization decisions for production changes following ITIL 4 Change Enablement. The CAB evaluates change requests, reviews risk assessments and certification evidence, votes on approval/rejection, assigns change windows, and establishes rollback authorization criteria based on risk classification and operational impact.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- ITIL 4 Change Enablement classification (standard, normal, emergency changes)
- CAB meeting minutes with attendance, agenda, and discussion summary
- Change request details (change ID, requestor, description, business justification)
- Risk assessment review (FMEA scores, blast radius, MTTR estimates, mitigation strategies)
- Release certification validation (quality gates, security scans, performance tests passed)
- Voting records (approve, reject, abstain) with member names and timestamps
- Approval conditions and caveats (conditional approvals requiring specific actions)
- Change window assignment (approved deployment date/time, maintenance window)
- Rollback authorization (pre-approved rollback authority, rollback triggers)
- Stakeholder sign-offs (engineering, operations, security, product management, executive)
- ServiceNow Change Management integration (change request tickets, approval workflow states)
- Jira Service Management integration (change tickets, approval gates)
- Standard change pre-authorization criteria (low-risk, repeatable changes with documented procedures)
- Emergency change expedited process (high-urgency changes with post-implementation review)
- Change freeze periods (blackout windows for holiday seasons, major events, fiscal close)

**Out of Scope**:
- Detailed release risk assessment methodology (handled by release-risk-assessment.md)
- Release certification checklist details (handled by release-certification.md)
- Go/no-go decision meeting minutes (handled by go-no-go-minutes.md)
- Actual deployment execution procedures (handled by deployment runbooks)

### Target Audience

**Primary Audience**:
- Change Advisory Board (CAB) members voting on change approvals
- Release Managers submitting change requests and coordinating CAB reviews
- IT Service Management (ITSM) coordinators facilitating CAB meetings
- Engineering Managers presenting changes and answering CAB questions
- Operations Directors evaluating operational impact and resource availability

**Secondary Audience**:

- Internal/External Auditors reviewing change management evidence (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- Executive Leadership monitoring high-risk or high-visibility change approvals
- Product Managers understanding deployment timelines and change windows
- Customer Success Teams planning customer communication around changes

## Best Practices

**Risk-Based Classification**: Use ITIL 4 change types (standard, normal, emergency) based on risk assessment scores
**Pre-Submission Package**: Require complete change request package (risk assessment, certification, runbook) before CAB review
**Quorum Requirements**: Define minimum CAB member attendance for valid voting (e.g., 75% of voting members present)
**Timely Submission**: Establish change request submission deadlines before CAB meetings (e.g., 3 business days advance notice)
**Evidence-Based Decisions**: Base approval decisions on objective criteria (test results, risk scores) not subjective opinions
**Conditional Approval Clarity**: Clearly document conditions that must be met before deployment proceeds
**Standard Change Pre-Authorization**: Pre-approve low-risk, repeatable changes to reduce CAB meeting overhead
**Change Window Coordination**: Maintain master change calendar to prevent conflicting deployments
**Rollback Pre-Authorization**: Pre-approve rollback authority and triggers as part of initial change approval
**Post-Implementation Review**: Mandate PIR for all normal and emergency changes within 48 hours
**Emergency Change Criteria**: Define clear, objective criteria for emergency classification to prevent abuse
**Attendance Tracking**: Track CAB member participation rates and address chronic absence
**Decision Documentation**: Capture rationale for approval/rejection decisions, not just vote outcomes
**Approval Audit Trail**: Maintain immutable record of all approval decisions with timestamps and digital signatures
**Change Freeze Communication**: Publish change freeze calendars well in advance (e.g., 90 days for holiday freeze)
**Rejection Feedback**: Provide actionable feedback to requestors on rejected changes for resubmission
**Delegation Authority**: Document clear delegation chains for member unavailability
**ServiceNow Integration**: Automate CAB workflow in ITSM tool (ServiceNow, Jira Service Management)
**Voting Transparency**: Make CAB voting records visible to stakeholders (within appropriate access controls)
**Continuous Improvement**: Review CAB process effectiveness quarterly and optimize based on metrics

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
