# Name: eviction-policies

## Executive Summary

The Eviction Policies artifact defines strategies for removing stale, unused, or low-value data from caches, feature flag systems, and data storage layers. This artifact establishes eviction algorithms (LRU, LFU, LRA, TTL), retention policies, cleanup automation, and governance processes that prevent resource exhaustion, manage technical debt, and optimize system performance across Redis, Memcached, feature flag platforms, and data warehouses.

Eviction policies are critical for maintaining system health and operational efficiency. Without proper eviction strategies, caches grow unbounded causing memory pressure, feature flags accumulate creating technical debt, and storage costs escalate from retaining unnecessary data. This artifact specifies cache eviction algorithms for Redis and Memcached, feature flag cleanup schedules, data retention policies with compliance requirements, and automated purging mechanisms that balance performance, cost, and data governance needs.

### Strategic Importance

## Best Practices

**Choose Appropriate Eviction Algorithm**: Use LRU for general caching, LFU for stable access patterns, TTL for time-sensitive data
**Monitor Cache Hit Rates**: Track hit rates before/after eviction changes; aim for >80% hit rate for performance-critical caches
**Set Memory Limits**: Configure maxmemory for Redis with headroom (80-90% of available memory) to prevent OOM errors
**Redis Eviction Selection**: Use volatile-lru for caches with explicit TTLs; allkeys-lru when all keys are candidates
**TTL Consistency**: Set TTLs at write time; avoid infinite TTLs unless data is truly permanent
**Feature Flag Expiration**: Set expiration dates on all feature flags at creation; default to 90 days for temporary flags
**Quarterly Flag Cleanup**: Schedule quarterly cleanup sprints to review and remove stale feature flags
**Automated Stale Detection**: Implement automated detection of flags at 100% rollout for >90 days
**Compliance-First Retention**: Start with regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX) as baseline for retention policies
**Document Retention Justification**: Every retention policy must have documented business or compliance justification
**Tiered Storage Strategy**: Implement hot/warm/cold tiers to balance access performance and cost
**Automate Lifecycle Transitions**: Use cloud provider lifecycle policies to automatically tier and purge data
**Log Retention Balance**: Balance forensic needs (longer retention) with storage costs (shorter retention)
**Soft Delete First**: Implement soft deletion with grace period before hard deletion for recovery
**Monitoring and Alerting**: Alert on cache eviction rate spikes, memory pressure, and cleanup job failures
**Test Eviction Policies**: Test eviction behavior under load before production deployment
**Cost Tracking**: Monitor storage costs by tier and adjust retention policies to optimize spend
**Backup vs. Archive**: Distinguish between operational backups (short retention) and compliance archives (long retention)
**Grace Periods**: Implement grace periods (30-90 days) before permanent deletion to allow recovery
**Document Dependencies**: Document which systems depend on cached data to assess eviction impact
**Right-to-Delete Automation**: Implement automated GDPR/CCPA deletion workflows with audit trails

   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version
