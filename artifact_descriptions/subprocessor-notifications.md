# Name: subprocessor-notifications

## Executive Summary

The Subprocessor Notifications artifact provides legally-compliant templates for notifying customers of subprocessor changes, additions, and removals as required by GDPR Article 28, CCPA service provider requirements, and Data Processing Agreements (DPAs). These notifications ensure customers maintain visibility into their data processing supply chain, exercise objection rights per GDPR Article 28(9), and make informed decisions about vendor relationships involving subprocessor additions.

GDPR Article 28(2) requires data processors to obtain prior authorization before engaging subprocessors, typically satisfied through general authorization with advance notification (30-day notice standard). Failure to provide proper subprocessor notification can result in contract breach, GDPR violations, and customer objections that disrupt vendor relationships. These templates establish standardized 30-day advance notice for new subprocessors, immediate notice for emergency vendor additions, and clear objection procedures allowing customers to exercise their GDPR rights.

### Strategic Importance

- **GDPR Article 28 Compliance**: Fulfills GDPR Article 28(2) requirement for processor authorization before engaging subprocessors
- **Contractual Obligation**: Meets DPA requirements for advance notice of subprocessor changes (typically 30 days)
- **Customer Objection Rights**: Enables customers to exercise GDPR Article 28(9) right to object to subprocessor changes
- **Supply Chain Transparency**: Maintains current subprocessor list accessible to customers (GDPR accountability principle)
- **Vendor Risk Management**: Communicates security and compliance vetting of new subprocessors to customers
- **Regulatory Audit Evidence**: Documents subprocessor notification history for GDPR compliance audits
- **Customer Relationship Protection**: Proactive notification prevents contractual disputes and customer surprise

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact serves as the template library for notifying customers of changes to the subprocessor list, ensuring compliance with GDPR Article 28(2), DPA contractual requirements, and CCPA service provider notification obligations. Templates define what information to communicate (subprocessor name, location, services provided, data access scope), notification timing (30-day advance notice standard), and customer objection procedures.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- New subprocessor addition notifications (30-day advance notice per GDPR Article 28 and DPA terms)
- Subprocessor removal notifications (immediate notice upon vendor offboarding)
- Subprocessor replacement notifications (vendor substitution scenarios)
- Emergency subprocessor additions (immediate notice with justification for waiving 30-day advance notice)
- Subprocessor list updates (quarterly or annual comprehensive list refresh)
- Data Processing Agreement (DPA) amendment notifications for subprocessor changes
- Subprocessor location changes (EU to non-EU transfers, new data center regions)
- Customer objection procedures (GDPR Article 28(9) right to object to subprocessor engagement)
- Subprocessor compliance evidence (SOC 2, ISO 27001 status of new vendors)

**Out of Scope**:
- Individual subprocessor security assessments (internal vendor risk management documentation)
- Subprocessor DPA negotiation details (handled by legal and procurement teams)
- Cloud infrastructure provider changes (AWS, GCP, Azure) if already listed as subprocessors
- Internal tooling and services without customer data access (Slack, Jira, HR systems)
- Business partner relationships that don't involve customer data processing
- Merger & acquisition notifications (covered through separate customer communications)

### Target Audience

**Primary Audience**:
- Legal & Privacy Teams: Ensure subprocessor notifications meet GDPR Article 28 and DPA requirements

## Best Practices

**30-Day Advance Notice**: Provide 30 days notice before new subprocessor begins processing customer data (GDPR Article 28 and DPA standard)
**Complete Vetting First**: Complete security assessment and DPA execution before notifying customers (demonstrate due diligence)
**Specific Data Access Scope**: Clearly state what customer data the subprocessor will access (PII, usage data, metadata, no data access)
**Subprocessor Location**: Specify data processing location and applicable data transfer mechanisms (SCCs for non-EU)
**Compliance Status**: Include subprocessor's SOC 2, ISO 27001, or other compliance certifications in notification
**Clear Objection Process**: Provide explicit instructions on how to object within 30-day window (email address, objection criteria)
**Trust Center Integration**: Maintain continuously-updated subprocessor list on trust center (not just quarterly emails)
**Emergency Exception Process**: Define emergency vendor addition criteria and immediate notification procedures
**Objection Response Plan**: Prepare alternative solutions or vendor substitutes in case customer objects
**Historical Notification Log**: Maintain audit trail of all subprocessor notifications sent (compliance evidence)
**No Retroactive Notice**: Never notify customers of subprocessor after data processing has begun (GDPR violation risk)
**Data Minimization Statement**: Explain why subprocessor is necessary and data access minimization measures
**Version-Controlled DPA**: Reference DPA version and subprocessor schedule amendment in notification
**Removal Notifications**: Proactively communicate when subprocessors are removed (builds trust)
**Category vs. Specific**: Consider category-based authorization for commoditized services (cloud hosting, email) vs. specific for unique vendors
**Legal Review**: Have legal counsel review notification templates annually for regulatory compliance
**Multi-Language Support**: Translate subprocessor notifications for non-English customers (EU multilingual requirements)
**Customer Portal Integration**: Allow customers to view historical subprocessor changes in customer portal
**Vendor Sunset Plan**: Provide transition timeline when replacing existing subprocessor with new vendor
**Proactive FAQ**: Publish FAQ addressing common subprocessor questions (reduces customer support burden)
