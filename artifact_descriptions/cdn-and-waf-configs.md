# Name: cdn-and-waf-configs

## Executive Summary

The CDN and WAF Configs artifact defines content delivery network and web application firewall configurations for cloud-native applications, specifying edge computing policies, security rules, caching behaviors, and threat protection mechanisms across global distribution networks. This artifact establishes the configuration-as-code foundation for CDN platforms (AWS CloudFront, Akamai, Cloudflare, Azure Front Door, Google Cloud CDN) and WAF solutions (AWS WAF, Cloudflare WAF, Imperva, F5 Advanced WAF, ModSecurity) to optimize content delivery performance while protecting against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, DDoS attacks, and sophisticated application-layer threats.

As a critical component of cloud infrastructure security and performance optimization, this artifact serves Cloud Platform Engineers implementing edge computing strategies, DevOps Engineers automating infrastructure deployments, Site Reliability Engineers ensuring global availability, and Security Engineers enforcing defense-in-depth protection. It balances performance optimization through intelligent caching, geographic routing, and compression with robust security through rate limiting, geo-blocking, bot management, and OWASP Core Rule Set implementation.

## Best Practices

**Version Control**: Store in centralized version control system (Git, SharePoint with versioning, etc.) to maintain complete history and enable rollback
**Infrastructure as Code**: Define CDN and WAF configurations using Terraform, AWS CDK, Pulumi, or CloudFormation for repeatability and auditability
**Edge Security First**: Implement defense-in-depth with WAF as primary application protection layer before traffic reaches origin servers
**Caching Strategy Optimization**: Configure appropriate TTL values based on content type (static assets: 1 year, API responses: seconds/minutes)
**OWASP Core Rule Set**: Deploy OWASP ModSecurity CRS as baseline WAF ruleset, customize based on application-specific false positive tuning
**Geo-Blocking Implementation**: Implement country-level restrictions based on business requirements and threat intelligence
**Rate Limiting**: Configure adaptive rate limiting per endpoint, IP address, and user session to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
**Bot Management**: Deploy bot detection and mitigation to distinguish legitimate crawlers from malicious bots and scrapers
**SSL/TLS Best Practices**: Enforce TLS 1.3, disable weak ciphers, implement HSTS, OCSP stapling, and certificate pinning where applicable
**Origin Shield**: Enable CDN origin shield to reduce origin load and improve cache hit ratios for globally distributed content
**Real-Time Monitoring**: Configure CloudWatch, Datadog, or Splunk integration for CDN/WAF metrics, security events, and performance analytics
**False Positive Tuning**: Continuously monitor WAF block/challenge logs, tune rules to minimize false positives while maintaining security posture
**Multi-CDN Strategy**: Consider multi-CDN architecture using Akamai + Cloudflare or CloudFront + Fastly for redundancy and performance optimization
**HTTP/3 Enablement**: Enable HTTP/3 (QUIC) for improved performance over lossy networks and mobile connections
**Edge Compute**: Leverage Lambda@Edge, CloudFront Functions, or Cloudflare Workers for request/response manipulation at edge locations
**Peer Review**: Have at least one qualified security engineer and platform architect review configurations before deployment
**Testing**: Validate WAF rules in audit/count mode before switching to block mode, test CDN caching behaviors thoroughly
**Regular Updates**: Review and update on scheduled cadence or when triggered by significant changes, new OWASP CRS releases, or emerging threats
**Retention Compliance**: Follow organizational retention policies for how long to maintain and when to archive/destroy

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
