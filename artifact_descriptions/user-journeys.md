# Name: user-journeys

## Executive Summary

User Journey Maps are comprehensive visualizations that document end-to-end user experiences across all touchpoints, channels, and interactions with a product or service, capturing user actions, thoughts, emotions, pain points, and opportunities for improvement. Created using frameworks like Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD), service design blueprints, and experience mapping methodologies, these artifacts leverage tools like Miro, Mural, Smaply, or UXPressia to provide holistic views of user experiences that inform product strategy, feature prioritization, and experience optimization.

These empathy-driven artifacts map the complete user journey from initial awareness through purchase, onboarding, active use, and renewal/advocacy, documenting personas, goals, tasks, touchpoints, channels, emotions, pain points, moments of truth, and improvement opportunities at each journey stage. Following design thinking and human-centered design principles, user journey maps integrate insights from user research, analytics, customer feedback, and stakeholder interviews to create shared understanding of user needs and drive experience improvements across product management, UX design, marketing, customer success, and development teams.

## Best Practices

**Evidence-Based**: Ground journey maps in real user research (interviews, observations, analytics) not assumptions
**Persona-Specific**: Create separate journey maps for distinct personas; avoid generic "all users" journeys
**End-to-End Coverage**: Map complete journey from awareness/need recognition through advocacy/renewal
**Emotion Curve**: Include emotional dimension showing user feelings (frustration, delight, confusion) throughout journey
**Pain Point Identification**: Clearly highlight pain points, friction, and barriers at each stage
**Quantitative Validation**: Support qualitative insights with metrics (conversion rates, time on task, NPS, CSAT)
**Touchpoint Mapping**: Document all touchpoints and channels where user interacts with product/service
**Jobs-to-be-Done**: Frame journey stages around jobs user is trying to accomplish, not just features used
**Moments of Truth**: Identify critical moments that significantly impact user perception and decision-making
**Opportunity Spotting**: Convert pain points into actionable improvement opportunities with priority
**Collaborative Creation**: Involve cross-functional stakeholders in journey mapping workshops
**Current vs. Future State**: Create current state journey first, then envision future optimized journey
**Visual Storytelling**: Use visual timeline format that tells compelling narrative of user experience
**Supporting Quotes**: Include actual user quotes from research to build empathy
**Touchpoint Ownership**: Assign stakeholder ownership for each touchpoint to enable accountability
**Regular Updates**: Update journey maps as user behaviors evolve and new research emerges
**Journey Metrics**: Define metrics to measure journey improvements (stage completion rates, satisfaction, time)
