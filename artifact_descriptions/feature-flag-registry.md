# Name: feature-flag-registry

## Executive Summary

The Feature Flag Registry is a comprehensive inventory and governance system for managing feature flags across the software delivery lifecycle. This artifact serves as the single source of truth for all feature flag configurations, targeting rules, rollout percentages, and lifecycle management across platforms like LaunchDarkly, Split.io, Unleash, Flagsmith, and CloudBees Feature Management.

Feature flags have become critical infrastructure for progressive delivery, enabling teams to decouple deployment from release, conduct canary releases, implement percentage rollouts, and maintain kill switches for immediate rollback. However, without proper governance, technical debt accumulates through abandoned flags, inconsistent naming conventions, and unclear ownership. This registry prevents flag sprawl, ensures compliance with release processes, and provides visibility into experimentation and rollout strategies across the organization.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact serves as the authoritative registry for all feature flags, providing centralized governance, lifecycle tracking, and technical debt management for feature flag infrastructure. It enables teams to maintain visibility into flag usage, enforce cleanup policies, and prevent flag sprawl that can degrade system performance and increase maintenance burden.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Feature flag inventory across all platforms (LaunchDarkly, Split.io, Unleash, etc.)
- Targeting rules, percentage rollouts, and segmentation strategies
- Flag lifecycle management (creation, rollout, retirement)
- Kill switch configurations for emergency rollback
- Ownership assignments and approval workflows
- Technical debt tracking for stale and deprecated flags
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines and deployment processes
- Compliance with release management policies

**Out of Scope**:
- A/B test experiment design and statistical analysis (covered by experiment-tracking-logs)
- Infrastructure-level circuit breakers and rate limiting
- Application configuration management unrelated to feature releases
- Business logic rules that don't control feature availability

### Target Audience

**Primary Audience**:
- Product Engineers managing feature rollouts and progressive delivery
- Platform Engineers maintaining feature flag infrastructure
- DevOps Engineers integrating flags with CI/CD pipelines
- Engineering Managers overseeing release strategies

**Secondary Audience**:
- Product Managers defining feature targeting and rollout plans

## Best Practices

**Flag Naming Conventions**: Establish consistent naming patterns (e.g., team-feature-date, product-experiment-variant) to enable filtering and automated cleanup
**Lifecycle Management**: Define clear phases (dev, staging, production) with automated promotion gates and approval workflows
**Expiration Policies**: Set expiration dates on all flags at creation; implement automated alerts 30/60/90 days before expiration
**Technical Debt Tracking**: Monitor stale flags (flags at 100% rollout for >90 days); establish quarterly cleanup sprints
**Kill Switch Readiness**: Maintain designated kill switches for critical features with documented rollback procedures and ownership
**Targeting Strategy**: Document targeting rules (user segments, geographies, beta tester lists) with clear business justification
**Progressive Rollout**: Follow staged rollout patterns: internal (5%), beta (10%), early adopters (25%), general (50-100%)
**Code References**: Use static analysis to track flag references in codebase; prevent deletion of flags still in use
**Performance Monitoring**: Track flag evaluation latency and cache hit rates; set SLOs for flag evaluation (<10ms p99)
**Ownership Assignment**: Every flag must have designated owner and approval chain; no orphaned flags
**Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive audit trails for all flag changes with change rationale and approver
**Testing Strategy**: Include flag permutations in test plans; use flag overrides in testing environments
**Documentation**: Maintain runbooks for high-risk flags including rollback procedures and incident response
**Version Control**: Store flag configurations as code (Terraform, YAML) alongside application code
**Regular Reviews**: Conduct monthly flag reviews to identify candidates for cleanup and technical debt reduction
**Metrics Dashboards**: Track flag count by team, flag age distribution, and cleanup velocity
**Change Management**: Route production flag changes through standard change approval process
**SDK Version Management**: Keep feature flag SDKs up to date; test new SDK versions in staging environments

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
