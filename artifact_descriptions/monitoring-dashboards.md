# Name: monitoring-dashboards

## Executive Summary

The Monitoring Dashboards artifact defines comprehensive visualization and alerting strategies for system observability using industry-standard platforms like Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, and Dynatrace. This artifact establishes standardized dashboards that implement the three pillars of observability (metrics, logs, traces) and proven monitoring methodologies including RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration), USE metrics (Utilization, Saturation, Errors), and Google's Four Golden Signals.

As a cornerstone of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices, monitoring dashboards enable real-time visibility into service health, performance anomalies, and user experience. These dashboards support proactive incident detection, capacity planning, and data-driven optimization by surfacing actionable insights from observability platforms like Prometheus, Elastic Stack, and OpenTelemetry collectors.

### Strategic Importance

- **Observability Excellence**: Implements unified monitoring across metrics, logs, and traces using OpenTelemetry standards and vendor-agnostic instrumentation
- **SRE Practice Enablement**: Supports error budget tracking, SLO monitoring, burn rate alerts, and reliability decision-making per Google SRE Book principles
- **Proactive Detection**: Identifies performance degradation, resource saturation, and anomalies before they impact users through intelligent alerting and ML-powered detection
- **Service Health Visibility**: Provides real-time insights into service dependencies, distributed tracing, and end-to-end request flows across microservices architectures
- **Performance Optimization**: Enables data-driven capacity planning, cost optimization, and resource allocation through historical trend analysis
- **Incident Response**: Accelerates MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution) by providing contextualized dashboards for on-call engineers and incident commanders
- **Continuous Improvement**: Facilitates blameless post-mortems and reliability improvements through detailed metrics, logs, and trace correlation

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact defines standardized monitoring dashboard configurations that visualize system health, performance metrics, and user experience across distributed systems. It establishes reusable dashboard templates implementing RED metrics (request Rate, Error rate, Duration), USE metrics (Utilization, Saturation, Errors), and service-specific KPIs using platforms like Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, and Kibana. The dashboards enable real-time anomaly detection, capacity planning, SLO tracking, and rapid incident triage.

## Best Practices

**Dashboard as Code**: Store Grafana/Datadog dashboard definitions in Git using JSON/Terraform for version control, peer review, and automated provisioning
**RED Metrics Implementation**: Implement request Rate, Error rate, and Duration (latency) for all user-facing services following SRE methodology
**USE Metrics for Resources**: Track Utilization, Saturation, and Errors for all infrastructure resources (CPU, memory, disk, network, database connections)
**Consistent Time Windows**: Standardize time ranges (1h, 6h, 24h, 7d, 30d) and refresh intervals across dashboards for consistent user experience
**Multi-Level Dashboards**: Create hierarchical dashboards (executive overview, service health, detailed diagnostics) for different audiences and drill-down analysis
**Alert Integration**: Link dashboard panels directly to alert definitions; include alert status indicators and firing alert counts
**Percentile Latencies**: Always show P50, P90, P95, P99 latency percentiles rather than averages; avoid mean/average for latency metrics
**Cardinality Management**: Limit high-cardinality labels in Prometheus queries; use recording rules for expensive aggregations
**Template Variables**: Use Grafana variables for environment, region, service, instance to enable dashboard reuse across deployments
**Anomaly Detection**: Leverage platform-native ML features (Datadog Watchdog, New Relic Applied Intelligence) for automatic anomaly detection
**Service Dependency Maps**: Include service mesh topology, distributed tracing flame graphs, and dependency visualizations
**Cost Visibility**: Add infrastructure cost panels to resource utilization dashboards for FinOps awareness
**Dark Theme Support**: Design dashboards for readability in both light and dark modes; use colorblind-friendly palettes
**Performance Optimization**: Limit dashboard query complexity; use data source caching, query result limits, and time-based sampling
**Documentation Links**: Embed runbook links, alert documentation, and troubleshooting guides directly in dashboard panels
**SLO Integration**: Display current SLO compliance, error budget remaining, and burn rate alerts prominently on service dashboards
**Regular Review Cycles**: Review and update dashboards quarterly; remove unused panels, optimize queries, incorporate feedback from incidents

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
