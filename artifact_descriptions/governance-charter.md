# Name: governance-charter

## Executive Summary

The Governance Charter is a Board-approved foundational document that establishes the governance committee structure, decision rights, RACI matrix, escalation paths, and operating model for enterprise governance aligned to COBIT 2019, ISO 38500, and ITIL 4 frameworks. This critical artifact formalizes governance committee composition (membership, charter, meeting cadence), defines decision-making authority levels, establishes escalation procedures, and integrates with GRC platforms like ServiceNow GRC, RSA Archer, or MetricStream for governance workflow automation and decision tracking.

As the authoritative governance framework document, this artifact serves Board of Directors, Governance Committees, Executive Leadership, Risk Managers, Compliance Officers, and Enterprise Architects by providing clarity on who makes what decisions, accountability assignments (RACI), approval authority thresholds, and governance committee operating procedures. It supports COBIT governance domains (EDM - Evaluate, Direct, Monitor), ISO 38500 governance principles, and TOGAF governance frameworks.

### Strategic Importance

- **Committee Structure**: Establishes formal governance committees (Board Risk Committee, Executive Steering Committee, Architecture Review Board, Change Advisory Board) with defined membership, charter, authority, and cadence
- **Decision Rights**: Defines clear decision-making authority using RACI framework (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) preventing ambiguity and enabling swift decisions
- **Escalation Paths**: Documents escalation procedures with thresholds, timelines, and escalation chains ensuring issues reach appropriate decision-makers
- **Operating Model**: Specifies governance operating procedures including meeting cadence, quorum requirements, voting procedures, and documentation requirements
- **Accountability Framework**: Assigns accountability for governance domains using Three Lines of Defense model (1st line owns, 2nd line oversees, 3rd line provides assurance)
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Satisfies regulatory governance requirements (SOX Section 302/404, SOC 2 CC1, ISO 27001 A.5.1, COBIT EDM domains)
- **Strategic Alignment**: Links governance structure to organizational strategy ensuring governance enables rather than impedes business objectives

## Purpose & Scope

   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
