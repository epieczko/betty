# Name: trust-center-evidence-summaries

## Executive Summary

The Trust Center Evidence Summaries artifact provides executive-friendly, customer-facing summaries of complex compliance reports and security evidence, including SOC 2 Type II audit reports, ISO 27001 certification statements, penetration test results, and security control evidence. These summaries translate technical compliance documentation into accessible formats suitable for publication in trust centers (Vanta, Drata, Secureframe, OneTrust) while maintaining audit integrity and confidentiality requirements.

Enterprise customers frequently lack the compliance expertise to interpret full SOC 2 reports or penetration test findings. Evidence summaries bridge this gap by highlighting key compliance achievements (clean audit opinion, zero high-severity findings), control effectiveness, and security posture in plain language. These summaries accelerate customer security reviews by 50-70% while reducing the burden on security teams to repeatedly explain the same compliance evidence.

### Strategic Importance

- **Customer Accessibility**: Translates technical compliance reports (SOC 2, ISO 27001, penetration tests) into executive summaries accessible to non-security buyers
- **Due Diligence Acceleration**: Reduces customer security review time by providing pre-answered evidence for common questionnaire items
- **Control Evidence Transparency**: Demonstrates security control effectiveness through sanitized evidence excerpts and testing results
- **Audit Opinion Clarity**: Clearly communicates SOC 2 audit opinions, ISO 27001 certification status, and any qualifications or exceptions
- **Continuous Assurance**: Provides point-in-time and continuous monitoring evidence from platforms like Vanta and Drata
- **Risk Communication**: Transparently addresses identified risks, remediation timelines, and compensating controls
- **Third-Party Validation**: Leverages independent auditor opinions and certifying body statements to build credibility

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact serves as customer-facing summaries of compliance audit reports, security testing results, and control evidence, designed to be published in trust center platforms. These summaries answer the question "What compliance certifications and security controls does this vendor have?" in a format accessible to both technical and non-technical security reviewers.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- SOC 2 Type II audit report summaries (audit opinion, testing period, Trust Services Criteria covered, exception summary)
- ISO 27001/27701 certification summaries (certifying body, certification scope, validity period, surveillance audit status)
- Penetration test executive summaries (testing methodology, scope, high-level findings, remediation status)
- Security control evidence summaries (encryption standards, access controls, monitoring capabilities, backup procedures)
- Compliance framework mappings (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS control coverage)
- Third-party security assessment summaries (vendor risk assessments, cloud provider certifications)
- Bug bounty program results (program scope, severity distribution, resolution SLAs)
- Security monitoring evidence (SIEM coverage, incident detection capabilities, log retention)

**Out of Scope**:
- Full SOC 2 Type II reports with detailed testing procedures (provided under NDA upon request)
- Complete penetration test reports with exploit details and vulnerability specifics (security risk)
- Customer-specific data processing details (handled through DPAs and processing records)
- Incident response playbooks and internal procedures (operational security concern)
- Source code or architecture details beyond high-level diagrams (intellectual property)
- Individual employee access logs or authentication records (privacy concern)

### Target Audience

**Primary Audience**:
- Customer Security Teams: Evaluate vendor compliance and security controls during procurement
- Compliance & Risk Officers: Assess vendor adherence to required frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA)
- Procurement Teams: Verify security requirements are met before contract execution

**Secondary Audience**:
- Sales Engineering: Provide evidence to accelerate security reviews and answer compliance questions
- Customer Success: Address ongoing customer security inquiries and audit requests
- Internal Audit Teams: Validate published evidence accuracy and appropriateness

## Best Practices

**Auditor Approval Required**: Obtain written approval from SOC 2 auditor before publishing any summary of audit report (AICPA attestation standards)
**Accuracy to Source**: Ensure summary accurately reflects full report findings; never misrepresent audit opinion or testing results
**Exception Transparency**: If SOC 2 report contains exceptions or qualifications, summarize them clearly rather than omitting
**Validity Period Clarity**: Clearly state testing period for SOC 2 (e.g., "Oct 1, 2024 - Sep 30, 2025") and certification expiry for ISO 27001
**Remediation Status**: For penetration test summaries, clearly indicate which findings have been remediated and which remain open
**Severity Distribution**: Use standard severity classifications (Critical, High, Medium, Low) consistent with CVSS v3.1 scoring
**Visual Evidence Dashboard**: Use compliance status dashboards with visual indicators (green checkmarks) for active certifications
**Plain Language Translation**: Translate technical control descriptions into business benefits (e.g., "AES-256 encryption" → "Bank-grade encryption protects data")
**Framework Mapping**: Show how SOC 2 controls map to other frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001) to answer multi-framework questions
**Continuous Monitoring Badge**: Display real-time compliance status from Vanta/Drata showing continuous control monitoring
**Third-Party Validation**: Always cite independent auditor or certifying body name (e.g., "Audited by Deloitte," "Certified by BSI")
**Redaction Review**: Have security team review summaries to ensure no sensitive vulnerability details or exploitation methods are disclosed
**Attestation Letter**: Include attestation letters from auditors/certifying bodies as authoritative evidence
**Scope Clarity**: Clearly define what systems/services are covered by SOC 2 vs. out of scope
**Customer FAQ Integration**: Address common customer questions in evidence summaries ("Do you encrypt data at rest?" → link to encryption evidence)

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
