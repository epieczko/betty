# Name: firewall-rules

## Executive Summary

The Firewall Rules artifact defines network security policies and access control rules that govern traffic flow between network segments, cloud resources, and external networks to enforce defense-in-depth security architecture. This artifact specifies stateful firewall configurations across cloud-native security groups (AWS Security Groups, Azure Network Security Groups, GCP Firewall Rules), traditional firewall platforms (Palo Alto, Fortinet, Cisco ASA), and host-based firewalls (iptables, nftables, Windows Firewall) to implement least privilege access, network segmentation, and Zero Trust security principles while enabling legitimate application traffic and preventing unauthorized access.

As a foundational element of network security and cloud infrastructure protection, this artifact serves Security Engineers implementing defense-in-depth strategies, Network Engineers managing traffic segmentation, Cloud Platform Engineers enforcing cloud security posture, Site Reliability Engineers ensuring service availability, and Compliance Officers demonstrating regulatory adherence. It addresses critical security controls including ingress/egress filtering, micro-segmentation, DMZ isolation, jump host access patterns, and compliance requirements (PCI DSS network segmentation, HIPAA access controls, Zero Trust architecture).

## Best Practices

**Version Control**: Store firewall rules as infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi) in Git for change tracking and rollback
**Default Deny**: Implement default deny for both ingress and egress, explicitly allow only required traffic (whitelist approach)
**Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required access, prefer specific IP/CIDR over 0.0.0.0/0, specific ports over port ranges
**Rule Documentation**: Document business justification, owner, and expiration date for every firewall rule
**Stateful Inspection**: Use stateful firewalls to automatically allow return traffic for established connections
**Layer 7 Awareness**: For application-layer filtering, use next-generation firewalls (NGFW) or WAF, not just Layer 3/4 rules
**Micro-Segmentation**: Implement application-layer segmentation (separate web, app, database tiers with distinct security groups)
**Zero Trust Architecture**: Implement verify-explicitly, least-privilege, assume-breach principles with micro-segmentation
**Ingress Restrictions**: Limit public ingress to load balancers and bastion hosts only, never expose databases or app servers directly
**Egress Control**: Restrict outbound traffic to prevent data exfiltration, allow only required external services (APIs, package repos)
**Management Plane Isolation**: Isolate management interfaces (SSH, RDP, HTTPS admin) to dedicated management networks or VPN
**Bastion Host Pattern**: Require jump host/bastion access for SSH/RDP instead of direct internet exposure
**Source IP Restrictions**: Use specific source IPs or CIDR ranges rather than 0.0.0.0/0 wherever possible
**Service-to-Service**: Use security group references instead of IP addresses for intra-VPC communication (dynamic updates)
**Rule Consolidation**: Regularly audit and consolidate overlapping or redundant rules to reduce complexity
**Change Management**: Implement formal change request and approval process for firewall rule modifications
**Testing in Staging**: Test new firewall rules in staging/pre-production environment before production deployment
**Automated Compliance**: Use policy-as-code tools (Sentinel, OPA, Cloud Custodian) to enforce security group standards
**Threat Intelligence**: Integrate IP reputation feeds to automatically block known malicious sources
**Logging Everything**: Enable flow logs (VPC Flow Logs, NSG Flow Logs) and firewall logs for all traffic (accepted, denied)
**SIEM Integration**: Forward firewall logs to SIEM for correlation, alerting, and incident response
**Regular Audits**: Quarterly review of all firewall rules to remove unused rules and tighten overly permissive rules
**Emergency Access**: Define break-glass procedures for emergency access while maintaining audit trail
**Retention Compliance**: Follow organizational retention policies for how long to maintain and when to archive/destroy

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
