# Name: accessibility-requirements

## Executive Summary

The Accessibility Requirements artifact documents testable, specific requirements for ensuring digital products and services comply with accessibility standards including WCAG 2.1/2.2 (Levels A, AA, AAA), Section 508, EN 301 549, ADA Title III, and organizational inclusive design commitments. This artifact translates legal obligations and user needs into actionable technical specifications covering perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust (POUR) principles.

As a foundational requirements deliverable, this artifact serves product managers, UX/UI designers, developers, QA engineers, and accessibility specialists who need clear acceptance criteria for building inclusive experiences. Requirements span semantic HTML structure, ARIA implementation, keyboard navigation patterns, screen reader compatibility, color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum for normal text, 3:1 for large text per WCAG AA), focus management, error handling, time limits, seizure prevention, skip navigation, heading hierarchy, form labels, alternative text, captions, and transcripts. Each requirement includes success criteria, testing methods, WCAG criterion mapping, and priority (Must Have for Level A/AA, Should Have for Level AAA/enhanced).

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact serves as the definitive specification of accessibility requirements that digital products must satisfy, establishing testable acceptance criteria for WCAG 2.1/2.2 conformance, Section 508 compliance, ADA Title III obligations, and inclusive design principles. It provides clear, implementable requirements with verification methods for designers, developers, and QA teams.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA requirements (mandatory baseline)

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
