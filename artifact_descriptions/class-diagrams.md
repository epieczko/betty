# Name: class-diagrams

## Executive Summary

Class Diagrams are fundamental UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams that represent the static structure of object-oriented systems through classes, attributes, methods, and relationships. These diagrams serve as blueprints for software systems, enabling architects and developers to visualize, document, and communicate the structural design of applications before and during implementation.

As a cornerstone of object-oriented design, class diagrams bridge conceptual domain modeling and technical implementation by defining entities, their properties, behaviors, and how they interact. They support code generation, database schema design, API definition, and serve as living documentation that evolves with the system. Class diagrams enable design pattern implementation, facilitate refactoring decisions, and provide a common visual language for technical stakeholders.

### Strategic Importance

- **Design Communication**: Provides universal visual language for communicating complex object-oriented designs across distributed teams
- **Code Generation**: Enables automated code skeleton generation from models, accelerating development and ensuring design consistency
- **System Understanding**: Facilitates rapid onboarding and system comprehension by visualizing relationships and dependencies
- **Database Design**: Supports database schema design through entity-relationship mapping and normalization
- **API Definition**: Documents API contracts, DTOs, and domain models for microservices and distributed systems

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact serves as the authoritative visual representation of a system's static structure, defining classes, their attributes, operations, and relationships including inheritance, associations, aggregations, and compositions. It enables object-oriented analysis, design validation, and serves as reference for implementation and maintenance.

### Scope

- Stereotypes and tagged values for additional semantics
- Generalization hierarchies and polymorphic structures
- Design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Observer, etc.) representation
- Package organization and namespace structures
- Access modifiers (public, private, protected, package)
- Method signatures with parameters and return types
- Attribute data types and initial values
- Constraints, invariants, and business rules
- Domain models and business entities
- Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and view models
- Persistence models and ORM mappings

**Out of Scope**:

### Main Content Sections

(Content structure will vary based on specific artifact type. Include all relevant sections needed to fully document the subject matter.)

**Core Information**:
- Document the primary information this artifact is meant to capture

- Include sufficient detail for intended audience
- Provide examples where helpful

**Supporting Information**:
- Background context necessary for understanding

## Best Practices

**Appropriate Granularity**: Include enough detail for implementation but avoid cluttering diagram with every getter/setter; focus on business-meaningful operations
**Clear Naming**: Use domain-driven design naming that reflects business concepts; avoid technical jargon in domain models
**Package Organization**: Group related classes into packages/namespaces; show package dependencies in separate package diagrams
**Relationship Clarity**: Use correct UML relationship types (composition vs aggregation vs association); annotate multiplicity clearly
**Design Patterns**: Explicitly identify and label design pattern usage (Factory, Strategy, etc.) to communicate design intent
**Layered Architecture**: Organize classes by architectural layer (presentation, business, data) in separate diagrams or distinct packages
**Dependency Direction**: Ensure dependencies point toward stable abstractions; business logic should not depend on infrastructure
**Interface Segregation**: Define role-based interfaces; avoid god interfaces with excessive methods
**Stereotype Usage**: Use stereotypes (entity, service, repository, controller) to indicate architectural roles
**Version Control**: Store diagrams as code (PlantUML, Mermaid) in Git for diff tracking and code review integration
**Iterative Refinement**: Start with high-level domain model; progressively elaborate with implementation details
**Consistency Checks**: Validate diagram consistency with actual code using reverse engineering tools
**Documentation Integration**: Embed diagrams in living documentation (Confluence, wikis, README files)
**Tool Selection**: Choose tools that support collaboration (PlantUML for code, draw.io for GUI, Enterprise Architect for enterprise)
**Export Standards**: Standardize on vector formats (SVG) for scalability; provide both source and rendered versions
**Synchronization**: Keep diagrams synchronized with code through reverse engineering or automated model updates
**Association Naming**: Name associations with verbs describing the relationship; include direction arrows for clarity
**Visibility Markers**: Use standard UML visibility (+ public, - private, # protected, ~ package) consistently
**Type Specification**: Specify attribute types and method return types explicitly; include parameter types
**Abstract Indication**: Clearly indicate abstract classes (italics) and interfaces (stereotype or notation)
**Constraint Documentation**: Document constraints, invariants, and validation rules using OCL or notes
**Separation of Concerns**: Create separate diagrams for different concerns (domain model, DTOs, persistence layer)
**Incremental Detail**: Provide overview diagram plus detailed diagrams for complex subsystems

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
