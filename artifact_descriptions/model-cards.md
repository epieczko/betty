# Name: model-cards

## Executive Summary

Model Cards are structured documentation artifacts that transparently communicate ML model characteristics, intended use, performance metrics, limitations, and ethical considerations. Introduced by Google Research (Mitchell et al., 2019) and now an industry standard, model cards enable responsible AI deployment by providing stakeholders with the information needed to assess whether a model is appropriate for their use case and to understand its potential risks and biases.

As a cornerstone of responsible AI and ML governance, model cards provide ML engineers with performance benchmarks across demographic groups, product teams with clear guidance on appropriate model use, compliance teams with evidence of fairness testing, and end users with transparency about automated decisions that affect them. They serve as both technical documentation and ethical accountability mechanisms for AI systems.

### Strategic Importance

- **Responsible AI**: Documents fairness, bias, and ethical considerations required by AI governance frameworks
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Supports EU AI Act, GDPR Article 22 (automated decision-making), and algorithmic transparency requirements
- **Bias & Fairness**: Reports disaggregated performance metrics across demographic groups to identify disparate impact
- **Model Governance**: Enables model risk management, validation, and monitoring throughout the ML lifecycle
- **Transparency & Trust**: Provides stakeholders with clear understanding of model capabilities and limitations
- **Safe Deployment**: Prevents model misuse by documenting out-of-scope use cases and known failure modes
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Establishes baseline performance for detecting model drift and degradation

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

Model Cards document ML model details, intended use, training data, performance metrics (overall and disaggregated by demographic groups), limitations, bias testing results, and ethical considerations to enable informed decisions about model deployment and use while promoting transparency and accountability in AI systems.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Model details: Architecture, training data, preprocessing, features, hyperparameters
- Intended use: Primary use cases, target population, appropriate applications
- Out-of-scope use: Explicitly documented inappropriate or unsafe applications
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC overall and by demographic groups
- Fairness metrics: Disparate impact, equalized odds, demographic parity across protected attributes
- Bias testing: Results of fairness audits, synthetic data testing, adversarial testing
- Limitations: Known failure modes, edge cases, distributional shift sensitivity
- Training data: Dataset characteristics, sampling bias, data quality issues, consent/licensing
- Ethical considerations: Privacy implications, potential for harm, fairness trade-offs
- Model provenance: Versioning, lineage, responsible parties, approval status

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
