# Name: load-profiles

## Executive Summary

The Load Profiles artifact defines realistic user concurrency patterns, traffic distributions, and workload characteristics that represent actual production usage for performance testing and capacity planning. Load profiles document concurrent user counts, geographic distribution, business cycle patterns (daily peaks, seasonal trends), user behavior models (think times, transaction flows), and workload mix (read/write ratios, transaction types) to ensure load tests accurately simulate real-world conditions.

Accurate load profiles are essential for meaningful performance testing and capacity planning. They transform abstract requirements ("support 10,000 users") into concrete test scenarios ("500 concurrent users during business hours with 5-second think times executing 70% reads, 30% writes, peaking at 1,200 RPS during lunch hour"). By modeling realistic usage patterns including geographic distribution, time-of-day variations, and user journey diversity, load profiles ensure test results predict actual production performance.

### Strategic Importance

- **Realistic Testing**: Ensures load tests simulate actual user behavior rather than artificial uniform traffic patterns
- **Capacity Accuracy**: Enables accurate capacity planning by modeling real concurrency patterns and traffic distributions
- **Geographic Modeling**: Accounts for multi-region user distribution and network latency variations in global applications
- **Temporal Patterns**: Captures daily, weekly, and seasonal traffic variations for capacity planning and cost optimization
- **User Segmentation**: Models different user types (browsers, purchasers, admins) with appropriate transaction mixes
- **Business Alignment**: Links technical load patterns to business events (product launches, sales events, end-of-month processing)
- **Cost Optimization**: Informs auto-scaling policies and reserved capacity decisions based on predictable load patterns

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact defines realistic workload patterns for performance testing and capacity planning, documenting concurrent user counts, geographic distribution, temporal patterns (daily/seasonal peaks), user behavior models (think times, session durations), transaction mixes (read/write ratios), and business cycle correlations to ensure load tests accurately represent production usage.

- User segmentation: different user types (anonymous browsers, authenticated users, admins, API clients)
- Transaction mix: percentage breakdown of operations (browse, search, read, write, checkout, admin)
- Think times: realistic delays between user actions modeling human behavior (3-10 seconds typical)
- Session characteristics: average session duration, pages per session, conversion funnels
- Workload ratios: read/write ratios, cache hit expectations, database query distributions
- Business event correlation: product launches, marketing campaigns, end-of-period processing, seasonal events
