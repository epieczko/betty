# Name: cost-anomaly-alerts

## Executive Summary

The Cost Anomaly Alerts artifact defines automated detection of unexpected cloud spending using AWS Cost Anomaly Detection, Azure Cost Management anomaly alerts, GCP cost anomaly detection, and FinOps platform integrations. This artifact establishes spending baselines, anomaly detection thresholds, cost forecasting models, budget alerts, and notification workflows that prevent bill shock and enable proactive cost optimization.

As a cornerstone of FinOps practices, cost anomaly detection enables teams to identify misconfigured resources, unexpected traffic spikes, pricing model changes, and orphaned infrastructure before they result in significant overspending. Integration with AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management, GCP Cloud Billing, and third-party platforms (CloudHealth, Spot.io, Vantage) provides multi-cloud cost visibility and actionable alerts.

### Strategic Importance

- **Cost Governance**: Detects spending anomalies early (>20% variance from baseline) preventing budget overruns and bill shock
- **FinOps Enablement**: Implements FinOps Foundation principles with unit economics, cost allocation, tagging standards, and showback/chargeback
- **Forecasting Accuracy**: Uses ML-powered forecasting (AWS Cost Anomaly Detection, Azure ML) to predict monthly costs with 90%+ accuracy
- **Budget Enforcement**: Enforces departmental budgets with tiered alerts (80% warning, 90% critical, 100% breach) and automated remediation
- **Waste Reduction**: Identifies idle resources, oversized instances, unused reservations, and orphaned storage for cleanup
- **Multi-Cloud Visibility**: Aggregates costs across AWS, Azure, GCP, and SaaS vendors into unified cost dashboards and reports

## Best Practices

**Tagging Enforcement**: Require cost allocation tags (team, project, environment, cost-center) on all resources; reject untagged resources
**Tiered Alerts**: Set budget alerts at 50% (info), 80% (warning), 90% (critical), 100% (breach) thresholds
**Anomaly Thresholds**: Configure anomaly detection for >20% daily variance, >30% weekly variance from ML baseline
**Unit Economics**: Track cost per request, cost per user, cost per GB to identify efficiency trends and regressions
**Daily Reviews**: Review cost dashboards daily; investigate anomalies >$100/day immediately
**Forecasting**: Forecast monthly costs with 7-day, 14-day, 30-day lookback; update forecasts weekly
**Right-Sizing**: Analyze CPU/memory utilization weekly; downsize instances with <20% average utilization
**Reserved Instance Coverage**: Maintain 60-80% RI/savings plan coverage for stable workloads; use spot/on-demand for variable
**Waste Cleanup**: Automate detection and deletion of idle resources (7 days idle EC2, 30 days unattached EBS)
**Multi-Cloud Attribution**: Tag cloud provider, region, service for cross-cloud cost comparison and optimization
**Showback Reports**: Generate monthly showback reports per team/department for cost awareness and accountability
**Chargeback Models**: Implement chargeback for production environments; showback for dev/staging
**Cost Dashboards**: Publish real-time cost dashboards; send weekly summaries to engineering leaders
**Optimization Recommendations**: Auto-generate and prioritize cost optimization recommendations (RI purchases, rightsizing)
**Notification Routing**: Route anomaly alerts to team Slack channels, email DLs based on resource tags
**Seasonal Adjustments**: Account for seasonal traffic patterns (Black Friday, tax season) in anomaly baselines
**Commitment Review**: Review RI/savings plan commitments quarterly; adjust based on usage patterns and forecast
