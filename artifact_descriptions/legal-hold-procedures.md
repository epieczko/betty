# Name: legal-hold-procedures

## Executive Summary

The Legal Hold Procedures artifact defines the process for preserving electronically stored information (ESI) and physical documents when litigation, government investigations, or regulatory inquiries are reasonably anticipated. These procedures ensure compliance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) spoliation requirements, establish chain of custody for evidentiary materials, and coordinate preservation across email systems, cloud storage, databases, Slack/Teams channels, and backup archives.

Legal holds suspend normal data retention and deletion policies to prevent destruction of potentially relevant evidence. The procedures integrate with Microsoft 365 Litigation Hold, Google Vault, Slack eDiscovery, and third-party preservation platforms like Exterro, Zylab, or Relativity to automate custodian notifications, track acknowledgments, and ensure defensible preservation. This artifact addresses custodian identification, hold notice distribution, in-place preservation vs collection, preservation scope determination, regular hold reminders, and release procedures when holds are lifted. Compliance with these procedures protects against sanctions for evidence spoliation and ensures evidentiary integrity for litigation, regulatory examinations, and internal investigations.

## Best Practices

**Immediate Action**: Issue legal hold notices within 24-48 hours of litigation trigger to demonstrate good faith preservation
**Overcollection Preferred**: Preserve broadly initially; narrow scope later to avoid inadvertent destruction of relevant evidence
**Written Hold Notices**: Always issue written hold notices (email acceptable) with clear subject lines and acknowledgment requirements
**Custodian Acknowledgment**: Require affirmative acknowledgment from all custodians; track and escalate for non-responders
**Suspend Auto-Delete**: Immediately suspend all automated deletion policies, retention rules, and scheduled purges for in-scope data
**In-Place Holds Preferred**: Use litigation hold features (Microsoft 365, Google Vault) rather than collecting data prematurely
**Backup Tape Identification**: Identify and segregate backup tapes containing custodian data; maintain chain of custody
**Periodic Reminders**: Re-issue hold notices quarterly or when custodians change roles to reinforce preservation obligations
**New Custodian Onboarding**: Add newly identified custodians to hold immediately upon discovery of relevance
**Documentation Obsession**: Maintain detailed audit trail of all preservation actions, decisions, and communications
**Legal Counsel Collaboration**: Coordinate all hold procedures with legal counsel; don't make preservation scope decisions independently
**Mobile Device Preservation**: Use MDM (Intune, Jamf) to preserve mobile device content or collect forensic images
**Slack/Teams Holds**: Enable Slack Enterprise Grid holds or Teams eDiscovery to preserve chat and channel communications
**Cloud Storage Coordination**: Notify SaaS vendors (Salesforce, Workday) to preserve customer data relevant to litigation
**Metadata Preservation**: Ensure preservation captures metadata (timestamps, sender/recipient, edit history) not just content
**Privilege Considerations**: Coordinate with legal on preserving attorney-client communications without waiving privilege
**Third-Party Custodians**: Issue preservation letters to vendors, contractors, and partners holding relevant data
**Employee Exit Procedures**: Coordinate holds with offboarding to prevent data loss when custodians leave organization
**Hold Release Rigor**: Only release holds after written authorization from legal counsel; document release justification
**Defensibility Focus**: Every preservation decision should be made with "how will this look to a judge?" mindset
