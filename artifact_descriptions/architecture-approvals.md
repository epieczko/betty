# Name: architecture-approvals

## Executive Summary

The Architecture Approvals artifact documents formal decisions and authorizations from the Architecture Review Board (ARB) regarding architectural proposals, design patterns, technology selections, and architectural waivers. This governance artifact ensures that architectural decisions align with enterprise standards, technical strategy, and risk management frameworks while maintaining traceability through Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

Built on TOGAF 9.2 Architecture Governance framework principles, this artifact uses RACI matrix definitions to clarify accountability (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) for each decision type. It captures ARB review outcomes, approval conditions, exceptions granted with compensating controls, and sunset dates for time-limited approvals. The approval process integrates with ADR repositories (using Michael Nygard's template format), ensuring architectural decisions are captured, communicated, and enforced throughout the system lifecycle.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact provides authoritative record of ARB decisions, enabling enforcement of architectural governance, tracking of approved exceptions, and maintaining accountability for architectural choices. It supports audit trails for compliance, provides decision history for future reference, and communicates architectural guidance to delivery teams.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- ARB meeting decisions with approval/rejection rationale
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant choices using standard template (context, decision, status, consequences)

- Approval conditions, constraints, and dependencies
- Exception approvals with compensating controls and sunset dates
- Technology stack approvals and technology radar changes (adopt, trial, assess, hold)
- Architectural pattern approvals (microservices, event-driven, CQRS, etc.)
- Cloud architecture approvals aligned with AWS/Azure/GCP Well-Architected Framework
- Security architecture approvals aligned with NIST Cybersecurity Framework, Zero Trust principles
- Waiver approvals for deviations from architectural standards

## Best Practices

**ADR Repository Management**: Maintain ADRs in version-controlled repository (Git docs/adr/ directory) with sequential numbering (0001-microservices-pattern.md); use immutable records with superseded status rather than editing
**Standardized ADR Template**: Use consistent format - Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences, Compliance (references to standards), Alternatives Considered
**RACI Clarity**: Define explicit RACI matrix for each decision type; avoid multiple Accountable roles (only one A per decision); document in governance charter
**Timely Documentation**: Create ADR within 48 hours of ARB decision while context is fresh; link to meeting minutes and approval evidence
**Decision Traceability**: Link ADRs to architecture artifacts (C4 diagrams, component designs), requirements, and related decisions; create decision dependency graphs
**Approval Workflow Automation**: Use Jira/ServiceNow workflows with defined states (Submitted → Under Review → Approved/Rejected/Conditional); configure automated notifications
**Exception Management**: For waivers/exceptions, document compensating controls, risk acceptance, sunset dates, and remediation plans; track in risk register
**Technology Radar Updates**: Synchronize ARB decisions with organizational technology radar; move technologies between adopt/trial/assess/hold based on approvals
**Quality Attribute Validation**: Require measurable quality attribute scenarios (SEI format) for significant architecture decisions; define acceptance criteria
**Security Review Integration**: Mandate security architect review for decisions affecting security posture; reference NIST CSF, Zero Trust, OWASP standards
**Cloud Governance Alignment**: For cloud decisions, verify alignment with AWS/Azure/GCP Well-Architected Framework; document pillar-specific considerations
**Conditional Approval Tracking**: Use ticketing system to track remediation items for conditional approvals; require sign-off when conditions met
**Decision Communication**: Publish ADR summaries to architecture newsletter/wiki; present significant decisions in architecture community of practice forums
**Appeal Process**: Document clear appeal process for rejected proposals; define escalation path to CTO/CIO for disputed decisions
**Retrospective Reviews**: Quarterly review of ADRs to assess outcomes vs. predictions; update decision templates based on lessons learned
**Pattern Reuse**: Build library of approved architectural patterns from ADRs; create reference implementations and starter templates
**Compliance Mapping**: Tag ADRs with applicable compliance frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR); maintain compliance traceability matrix
**Sunset Date Enforcement**: Automated alerts 30/60/90 days before sunset dates for time-limited approvals; require renewal or decommissioning plan
**Meeting Preparation**: Require submission of architectural proposal 1 week before ARB meeting; distribute materials 48 hours in advance
**Quorum Requirements**: Define minimum ARB attendance for valid decisions; document voting procedures for split decisions
**Audit Trail**: Maintain immutable audit log of all approvals, modifications, and status changes; retain for compliance period (typically 7 years)

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
