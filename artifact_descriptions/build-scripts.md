# Name: build-scripts

## Executive Summary

Build Scripts are executable automation code that orchestrate the compilation, testing, packaging, and deployment of software applications within CI/CD pipelines. These scripts are foundational to achieving reliable, repeatable builds and implementing continuous delivery practices aligned with DORA metrics and Google SRE principles.

Modern build scripts leverage industry-standard tools (Make, Gradle, Maven, npm/yarn, Bazel) and integrate with CI/CD platforms (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Azure DevOps) to automate build workflows, enforce quality gates, and generate versioned artifacts. They reduce toil through automation, improve deployment frequency, and decrease lead time for changes—core objectives of elite-performing engineering teams.

### Strategic Importance

- **Deployment Frequency**: Enables multiple daily deployments through automated, reliable build pipelines
- **Lead Time Reduction**: Decreases time from commit to production through optimized build processes
- **Build Reproducibility**: Ensures consistent artifacts through deterministic builds and dependency management
- **Quality Assurance**: Enforces automated testing, code coverage, linting, and security scanning gates
- **Artifact Management**: Generates versioned, traceable artifacts with proper metadata and provenance
- **Build Performance**: Optimizes build times through caching, parallelization, and incremental builds
- **Developer Productivity**: Reduces manual intervention and context switching through automation

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

Build scripts automate the complete software build lifecycle from source code to deployable artifacts, implementing CI/CD best practices through executable code. They eliminate manual build processes, ensure consistency across environments, and enable rapid, reliable software delivery aligned with DevOps and SRE principles.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Build automation scripts (Makefile, build.gradle, pom.xml, package.json, BUILD files)
- CI/CD pipeline configuration (Jenkinsfile, .gitlab-ci.yml, .github/workflows)
- Compilation and dependency resolution (Maven, Gradle, npm, pip, Go modules)
- Automated testing execution (unit, integration, e2e test runners)
- Code quality gates (linters, formatters, SAST scanners, SonarQube integration)
- Artifact generation and versioning (Docker images, JAR/WAR files, binaries)
- Build optimization strategies (caching, parallelization, incremental builds)
- Environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, production builds)
- Build notifications and status reporting (Slack, email, dashboards)

**Out of Scope**:
- Infrastructure provisioning scripts (handled by Infrastructure as Code artifacts)
- Deployment and release automation (handled by deployment runbooks)
- Production monitoring and alerting (handled by observability artifacts)
- Application source code (handled by code repositories)
- Manual build procedures (superseded by automation)

### Target Audience

**Primary Audience**:
- Build Engineers creating and maintaining build automation
- DevOps Engineers integrating builds into CI/CD pipelines
- Software Developers executing and troubleshooting builds locally
- Release Managers coordinating build and release processes

**Secondary Audience**:
- SRE Teams monitoring build reliability and performance
- Security Engineers implementing security scanning gates
- QA Engineers configuring automated test execution
- Engineering Managers tracking build metrics and toil reduction

## Best Practices

**Build Automation First**: All builds must be fully automated; manual build steps create toil and inconsistency
**Pipeline as Code**: Store CI/CD pipeline configurations in version control alongside build scripts (GitOps)
**Idempotency**: Build scripts must produce identical artifacts when run multiple times with same inputs
**Fail Fast**: Detect and report build failures early; run fastest checks first (linting before lengthy tests)
**Dependency Pinning**: Lock dependency versions (package-lock.json, Gemfile.lock, go.sum) for reproducibility
**Layer Caching**: Optimize Docker builds using multi-stage builds and appropriate layer ordering
**Parallel Execution**: Run independent build steps in parallel to minimize total build time
**Build Monitoring**: Track build duration, failure rates, and trends; set SLOs for build performance
**Artifact Versioning**: Use semantic versioning; tag builds with commit SHA and build number
**Clean Builds**: Support clean builds that don't rely on previous build artifacts or state
**Local Development Parity**: Ensure builds work identically in CI/CD and local development environments
**Resource Limits**: Define memory and CPU limits for build processes to prevent resource exhaustion
**Build Notifications**: Alert teams immediately on build failures; integrate with Slack, PagerDuty
**Incremental Builds**: Only rebuild changed components to reduce build time
**Build Caching**: Use distributed caching (Gradle cache, Docker layer cache, Bazel remote cache)
**Security Scanning**: Integrate SAST, dependency scanning, and container scanning into build pipeline
**Quality Gates**: Enforce minimum code coverage, linting compliance before allowing builds to proceed
**Build Reproducibility**: Use hermetic builds with pinned tool versions for bit-for-bit reproducibility
**Build Analytics**: Collect and analyze build metrics to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
**Self-Service Builds**: Enable developers to run builds locally with same tooling as CI/CD

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
