# Name: feasibility-study

## Executive Summary

The Feasibility Study is a comprehensive assessment artifact that evaluates whether a proposed initiative is viable across market, technical, financial, and operational dimensions. Using frameworks like SWOT analysis, Porter's Five Forces, PESTLE analysis, and TAM/SAM/SOM market sizing, this study provides executive leadership and portfolio management with evidence-based recommendations on whether to proceed, pivot, or pass on an opportunity.

Modern feasibility studies leverage collaborative platforms (Miro, Mural, Confluence) and financial modeling tools to analyze market opportunity, technical feasibility, resource requirements, and return on investment. The study synthesizes market research, competitive intelligence, technical assessments, and financial projections (NPV, IRR, payback period) into a decision-ready format. It directly feeds strategic decision frameworks like DACI (Driver, Approver, Contributor, Informed) and RAPID (Recommend, Agree, Perform, Input, Decide) to support go/no-go investment decisions.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

The Feasibility Study provides evidence-based analysis across market, technical, financial, and operational dimensions to support go/no-go investment decisions. It answers critical questions: Is there market demand? Can we build it? Will it be profitable? Do we have the capabilities? The study enables portfolio management and executive leadership to make informed decisions using structured frameworks (SWOT, Porter's Five Forces, financial analysis) and quantitative projections.

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
