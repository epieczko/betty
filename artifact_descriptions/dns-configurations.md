# Name: dns-configurations

## Executive Summary

DNS Configurations are the critical infrastructure artifacts that enable service discovery, load balancing, and automated certificate provisioning within cloud-native environments. Spanning from cluster-internal DNS (CoreDNS) to cloud provider DNS services (Route 53, Azure DNS, Cloud DNS), and automated DNS management (external-dns, cert-manager), these configurations ensure applications are discoverable, resilient, and secured with valid TLS certificates.

In modern Kubernetes architectures, DNS serves as the foundational service discovery mechanism, enabling pods to locate services by name, support multi-cluster communication, facilitate blue-green deployments, and automate certificate validation through DNS-01 challenges. Proper DNS architecture ensures high availability, low latency resolution, and seamless integration with service meshes, ingress controllers, and observability platforms.

### Strategic Importance

- **Service Discovery**: Enables automatic discovery of services within and across Kubernetes clusters
- **High Availability**: Provides resilient DNS resolution with multiple resolvers and caching strategies
- **Certificate Automation**: Facilitates automated TLS certificate issuance via DNS-01 ACME challenges (Let's Encrypt, cert-manager)
- **Multi-Cluster Networking**: Enables cross-cluster service discovery for hybrid and multi-cloud architectures
- **Traffic Management**: Supports weighted DNS for blue-green deployments, canary releases, and disaster recovery
- **Zero-Downtime Updates**: Allows DNS-based traffic shifting without application restarts or reconfiguration
- **Security & Compliance**: Implements DNSSEC, split-horizon DNS, and DNS-based security policies

## Best Practices

**NodeLocal DNSCache**: Deploy NodeLocal DNSCache to reduce DNS query latency and apiserver load
**DNS-01 for Wildcards**: Use DNS-01 ACME challenges for wildcard certificates instead of HTTP-01
**external-dns Ownership**: Configure external-dns with txt registry to prevent conflicts between multiple clusters
**Separate DNS Zones**: Use separate DNS zones for each environment (dev, staging, production) to prevent cross-environment pollution
**Appropriate TTLs**: Set short TTLs (30-60 seconds) for dynamic services, longer TTLs (300-3600 seconds) for static services
**Health Checks**: Implement Route 53 health checks for DNS-based failover and traffic management
**DNSSEC**: Enable DNSSEC for public DNS zones to prevent DNS spoofing and cache poisoning
**Split-Horizon DNS**: Use separate internal and external DNS zones for security and performance
**Certificate Renewal**: Configure cert-manager to renew certificates at least 30 days before expiration
**GitOps for DNS**: Manage external-dns and cert-manager configurations through GitOps for auditability
**Resource Requests**: Set appropriate resource requests/limits for CoreDNS pods based on cluster size
**Multiple DNS Resolvers**: Configure multiple upstream DNS resolvers for resilience
**Monitoring**: Monitor DNS query rates, errors, and latency using CoreDNS Prometheus metrics
**ndots Configuration**: Tune ndots value to minimize unnecessary DNS queries (default: 5, consider: 2-3)
**Autopath Plugin**: Consider CoreDNS autopath plugin to reduce DNS query round trips
**DNS Policy Testing**: Test DNS resolution from pods in different namespaces before production deployment
**Backup DNS Records**: Maintain backup of critical DNS records outside automation for disaster recovery
**Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on external-facing DNS to prevent abuse
**Private Link DNS**: Use AWS Route 53 Private Hosted Zones or Azure Private DNS for VPC/VNet-scoped resolution
**Certificate Monitoring**: Set up alerts for certificate expiration at 30, 14, and 7 days
