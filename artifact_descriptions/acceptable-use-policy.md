# Name: acceptable-use-policy

## Executive Summary

The Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is a formal directive that establishes organizational rules, standards, and requirements for appropriate use of information systems, networks, applications, and data. This governance artifact leverages industry frameworks including NIST SP 800-53 (AC-20, PS-6, PS-8), ISO 27001 (A.8.1.3, A.11.2), and CIS Controls v8 (5.4, 6.1, 6.2) to define permissible activities and prohibited behaviors for all users accessing organizational resources.

Modern AUPs address contemporary security challenges including shadow IT detection through Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) platforms (e.g., Netskope, Zscaler, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps), Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) management via Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) solutions (e.g., Intune, Jamf, VMware Workspace ONE), and acceptable use monitoring through Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools (e.g., Symantec DLP, Forcepoint, Digital Guardian) and User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) platforms (e.g., Exabeam, Splunk UBA, Microsoft Sentinel). The policy establishes clear boundaries around personal use, social media engagement, email usage, internet browsing, software installation, mobile device usage, remote access, and third-party service adoption.

### Strategic Importance

- **Risk Management**: Mitigates insider threats, data exfiltration, malware infections, and compliance violations through clearly defined usage boundaries and automated enforcement mechanisms
- **Compliance Assurance**: Ensures adherence to SOC 2 Type II (CC6.1, CC6.7), GDPR Article 32, CCPA, PCI DSS Requirement 12.3, HIPAA Security Rule 164.308(a)(3), and industry-specific regulations
- **Shadow IT Governance**: Controls unauthorized SaaS adoption, unmanaged cloud storage, and rogue application usage through CASB discovery and enforcement
- **BYOD Security**: Establishes mandatory mobile device management (MDM), containerization, and acceptable personal device usage patterns
- **Legal Protection**: Provides legal basis for monitoring, investigation, and employment actions; establishes no expectation of privacy for business systems
- **Incident Response Foundation**: Defines baseline for anomalous behavior detection and security incident investigation criteria

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact establishes mandatory requirements for appropriate use of all organizational technology resources, defines prohibited activities, specifies monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, and establishes accountability framework for user behavior. It serves as the foundation for security awareness training, user access agreements, violation investigation procedures, and progressive disciplinary actions.

**DLP Tuning**: Implement DLP policies in monitor-only mode for 60-90 days; tune false positives before enforcement mode
**BYOD Enrollment**: Offer incentives for voluntary MDM enrollment; clearly communicate privacy boundaries (what corporate IT can/cannot see)
**User Acknowledgment**: Require annual re-acceptance of AUP; track acknowledgments in HRIS; block access for non-compliant users
**Monitoring Transparency**: Clearly communicate that systems are monitored; eliminate expectation of privacy; comply with jurisdictional notification requirements
**Acceptable Personal Use**: Define reasonable limits (e.g., 30 minutes/day) rather than absolute prohibition; increases compliance and morale
**Progressive Discipline**: Establish tiered response (1st offense: warning + training, 2nd: written warning, 3rd: suspension, 4th: termination); exceptions for egregious violations
**Executive Exemptions**: Avoid creating executive carve-outs that undermine policy credibility; apply monitoring to all levels
**Regular Awareness Training**: Integrate AUP into annual security awareness training; include real examples of violations and consequences
**Periodic Policy Reviews**: Review annually and after major incidents; update for new technologies (e.g., generative AI, ChatGPT usage)
**Metrics & Reporting**: Track violation rates by department, violation type, time-to-resolution; report to senior leadership quarterly
**Integration with Offboarding**: Ensure HR offboarding checklist includes AUP violation review and system access revocation verification

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
