# Name: cookie-policy

## Executive Summary

The Cookie Policy is a public-facing transparency notice disclosing website cookies, tracking technologies, and similar identifiers to satisfy ePrivacy Directive consent requirements, GDPR Article 6(1)(a) lawful basis for non-essential cookies, PECR (UK Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations), and CCPA/CPRA opt-out obligations. This critical privacy artifact explains cookie purposes, categories (strictly necessary, functional, analytics, advertising), retention periods, and third-party cookie setters enabling informed user consent decisions through cookie consent banners.

Modern cookie policies integrate with Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) like Cookiebot, OneTrust Cookie Consent, Osano, Usercentrics, and Termly to automatically scan websites for cookies, classify cookie categories, generate policy content, and synchronize consent banner configurations. Organizations implement cookie consent workflows compliant with GDPR's requirement for freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent per Article 4(11), honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) opt-out preference signals per CCPA/CPRA, and maintain consent records demonstrating GDPR Article 7 accountability for consent validity.

### Strategic Importance

- **ePrivacy Directive Compliance**: Satisfies EU Cookie Law requiring prior consent for non-essential cookies and similar tracking technologies
- **GDPR Article 6(1)(a) Consent**: Establishes lawful basis for cookie processing through valid consent meeting Article 4(11) and Article 7 requirements
- **PECR Compliance**: Addresses UK Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations cookie consent and information requirements
- **CCPA/CPRA Opt-Out**: Supports California consumer opt-out rights for cookie-based sale/sharing of personal information and cross-context behavioral advertising
- **Regulatory Penalty Avoidance**: Mitigates ePrivacy fines (up to €20 million per GDPR Article 83), CNIL cookie consent enforcement, and ICO PECR violations
- **User Trust and Transparency**: Builds consumer confidence through clear cookie disclosures and granular consent controls in preference centers
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automates cookie discovery, policy updates, and consent management through Cookiebot, OneTrust, or Osano platforms

**Naming Conventions**: Follow organization's document naming standards for consistency and discoverability
**Template Usage**: Use approved templates to ensure completeness and consistency across teams
**Peer Review**: Have at least one qualified peer review before submitting for approval
**Metadata Completion**: Fully complete all metadata fields to enable search, classification, and lifecycle management
**Stakeholder Validation**: Review draft with key stakeholders before finalizing to ensure alignment and buy-in
**Plain Language**: Write in clear, concise language appropriate for the intended audience; avoid unnecessary jargon

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
