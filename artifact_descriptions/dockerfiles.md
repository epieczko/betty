# Name: dockerfiles

## Executive Summary

The Dockerfiles artifact defines container image build specifications that transform application source code into production-ready, immutable container images optimized for security, size, and performance. This artifact establishes multi-stage build patterns, base image selection strategies (Alpine Linux, Distroless, Ubuntu), layer optimization techniques, security hardening practices, and vulnerability scanning integration (Trivy, Grype, Snyk) to produce minimal-attack-surface container images that comply with CIS Docker Benchmark standards and organizational security policies.

As a critical component of container security and CI/CD pipelines, this artifact serves DevOps Engineers implementing containerization strategies, Cloud Platform Engineers optimizing image size and build performance, Security Engineers enforcing container security baselines, and Backend Developers packaging applications for cloud-native deployment. It addresses the entire container image lifecycle from base image selection through build optimization, security scanning, signing, and registry distribution while maintaining fast build times through effective layer caching and multi-stage build patterns.

## Best Practices

**Version Control**: Store Dockerfiles in Git alongside application source code, use semantic versioning for image tags
**Multi-Stage Builds**: Implement multi-stage builds with separate builder and production stages to reduce final image size by 60-90%
**Minimal Base Images**: Use Alpine Linux (5MB), Distroless (<20MB), or scratch images instead of full Ubuntu/Debian (100MB+)
**Base Image Pinning**: Pin specific base image digests (`FROM alpine:3.18.2@sha256:...`) for reproducible builds
**Non-Root User**: Run containers as non-root user (USER 1001) to limit blast radius of container escape vulnerabilities
**Layer Optimization**: Order Dockerfile instructions from least to most frequently changing to maximize layer cache hits
**Package Manager Caching**: Use BuildKit cache mounts for package managers (`--mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip`)
**Dependency Pinning**: Pin exact dependency versions in package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod to ensure reproducible builds
**Security Scanning**: Integrate Trivy or Grype in CI pipeline, fail builds on HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities
**Secrets Management**: Never hardcode secrets in Dockerfile or layers, use BuildKit secret mounts or environment variables at runtime
**.dockerignore**: Create comprehensive .dockerignore to exclude .git, node_modules, test files from build context
**Image Labels**: Add OCI annotations (org.opencontainers.image.created, source, revision) for traceability
**Health Checks**: Define HEALTHCHECK instruction for container liveness detection
**Shell Forms vs Exec Forms**: Use exec form for ENTRYPOINT/CMD (`["executable", "arg1"]`) to ensure proper signal handling
**Minimize Layers**: Combine RUN commands with && to reduce layer count and image size
**Remove Build Dependencies**: In multi-stage builds, leave build tools in builder stage, copy only runtime artifacts
**Static Binaries**: For Go, build static binaries and use scratch base image for 10MB or smaller final images
**Vulnerability Management**: Subscribe to security advisories for base images, automate image rebuilds on security updates
**Image Signing**: Sign production images with Cosign for supply chain security verification
**SBOM Generation**: Generate Software Bill of Materials using Syft for vulnerability tracking and compliance
**BuildKit Features**: Enable BuildKit for parallel builds, improved caching, and secret management
**Multi-Architecture**: Build for multiple architectures (amd64, arm64) using docker buildx for broad platform support
**Regular Updates**: Rebuild images monthly to pick up base image security patches, even without application changes
**Retention Compliance**: Follow organizational retention policies for how long to maintain and when to archive/destroy

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
