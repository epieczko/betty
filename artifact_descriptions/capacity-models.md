# Name: capacity-models

## Executive Summary

The Capacity Models artifact applies queueing theory, Little's Law, and empirical performance data to predict system behavior under varying loads and inform infrastructure sizing decisions. Capacity models document resource utilization targets (CPU <70%, memory <80%), scaling characteristics (linear vs. sub-linear), bottleneck analysis, and growth projections to ensure systems maintain performance SLOs while optimizing infrastructure costs through right-sizing.

Capacity models translate load profiles and performance test results into infrastructure requirements. Using principles like Little's Law (L = λW relating concurrency, arrival rate, and service time) and queueing models (M/M/1, M/M/c for server pools), capacity planners predict required compute, memory, storage, and network resources. Models account for non-linear scaling effects, resource headroom for bursts, and cost optimization through horizontal vs. vertical scaling trade-offs.

### Strategic Importance

- **Infrastructure Sizing**: Determines compute, memory, storage, and network requirements to meet performance SLOs
- **Cost Optimization**: Balances performance requirements against infrastructure costs through right-sizing
- **Scaling Strategy**: Informs horizontal vs. vertical scaling decisions and auto-scaling policy configuration
- **Headroom Planning**: Ensures sufficient capacity buffer (typically 30-50%) for traffic bursts and failover scenarios
- **Growth Planning**: Projects future capacity needs based on business growth and usage trend analysis
- **SLO Achievement**: Validates infrastructure capacity supports defined Service Level Objectives for latency and throughput
- **Budget Forecasting**: Enables accurate infrastructure budget planning based on predictable capacity requirements

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
