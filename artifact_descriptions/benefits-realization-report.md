# Name: benefits-realization-report

## Executive Summary

The Benefits Realization Report is a structured value measurement document that tracks actual achieved benefits against projected benefits from business cases, using KPI dashboards, baseline vs. actual comparisons, variance analysis, and value realization timelines. This artifact applies Benefits Management frameworks from MSP (Managing Successful Programmes), PRINCE2, and PMI standards to quantify financial returns (ROI, NPV), operational improvements (efficiency gains, cost savings), and strategic outcomes (market share, customer satisfaction) from investments and initiatives.

As a critical component of portfolio governance and value assurance, this artifact supports PMOs, Executive Leadership, Finance Teams, and Business Sponsors in demonstrating investment value, optimizing resource allocation, and justifying future investments. The report leverages balanced scorecard methodologies, OKR (Objectives and Key Results) tracking, and business intelligence tools (Tableau, Power BI, Qlik) to provide evidence-based accountability for promised benefits delivery and continuous improvement insights.
