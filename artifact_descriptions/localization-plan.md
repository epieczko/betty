# Name: localization-plan

## Executive Summary

The Localization Plan establishes the comprehensive strategy, market prioritization, resource allocation, and execution roadmap for translating and culturally adapting software products across 20-150+ global locales. This strategic planning artifact coordinates product localization (UI/UX translation), content localization (help docs, marketing), legal localization (terms, privacy policies), and market-specific customization (payment methods, currencies, compliance) enabling international expansion and revenue growth from global markets.

Modern localization programs manage 500K-5M+ translatable strings across web, mobile (iOS/Android), desktop, and help center properties using translation management systems (Crowdin, Lokalise, Phrase) integrated with continuous delivery pipelines. Organizations with mature localization plans achieve 40-60% faster time-to-market for new locales, 30-50% lower translation costs through translation memory reuse and machine translation post-editing, and 35-50% of revenue from international markets for global SaaS companies.

Effective localization plans balance market opportunity (TAM analysis, revenue potential) with localization complexity and cost, prioritizing high-value languages (Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese) serving 2-3 billion potential users. The plan defines locale tiers (Tier 1: full localization, Tier 2: partial localization, Tier 3: English-only with local currency), resource allocation across human translation vs machine translation, and launch criteria (90%+ translation completion, linguistic QA, functional testing).

### Strategic Importance

- **Revenue Growth**: Enables expansion to international markets representing 35-50% of SaaS revenue for global companies
- **Market Competitiveness**: Provides localized user experience matching local competitors and user expectations in 20-150+ markets
- **User Acquisition Cost**: Reduces CAC by 20-40% in localized markets through culturally-relevant messaging and local payment methods
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Satisfies local language requirements (EU language regulations, Quebec Bill 101, data privacy notice translations)
- **Customer Trust**: Builds user trust through native language support, local currencies, and cultural adaptation
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimizes translation spend through TM leverage (70-90% match rates), MT post-editing, and vendor management
- **Speed to Market**: Reduces time-to-market for new locales by 40-60% through continuous localization and automated workflows

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact serves as the strategic roadmap for product and content localization, defining market prioritization, resource allocation, translation methodologies, quality standards, and launch criteria for expanding to 20-150+ global locales. It solves the challenge of coordinating cross-functional localization efforts across Product, Engineering, Marketing, Legal, and Operations teams while balancing market opportunity with localization cost and complexity. The plan supports decision-making around locale tier assignments (full vs partial localization), translation methodology (human vs MT post-editing vs hybrid), TMS platform selection (Crowdin, Lokalise, Phrase), and launch readiness criteria (translation completion %, LQA scores, functional testing).

## Best Practices

**Market Opportunity Analysis**: Prioritize locales using TAM analysis, GDP per capita, internet penetration, payment infrastructure, and competitive landscape data
**Locale Tier Methodology**: Define clear tier criteria (Tier 1: 100% product+content, Tier 2: 60-80% product only, Tier 3: English + local payments) balancing investment with opportunity
**Phased Rollout Strategy**: Launch locales incrementally (5-10 per quarter) enabling learning, iteration, and resource optimization vs big-bang approaches
**Translation Memory Leverage**: Maximize TM match rates (70-90%) through consistent terminology, phraseology, and string structure reducing translation costs by 30-50%
**Machine Translation Strategy**: Leverage MT for low-priority content (help docs, FAQs) with professional post-editing reducing costs by 40-60% while maintaining quality
**Quality Tier Definition**: Define quality tiers (Premium: human+LQA for customer-facing UI, Standard: MT+post-editing for docs, Basic: raw MT for internal tools)
**Continuous Localization**: Implement continuous localization workflows auto-syncing strings to TMS, triggering translation, and deploying builds at completion milestones
**Pseudo-Localization First**: Run pseudo-localization builds testing UI expansion, character encoding, and RTL layouts before investing in translation
**String Freeze Discipline**: Establish string freeze windows (2-4 weeks before release) enabling complete translation and LQA cycles
**Glossary Governance**: Maintain centralized glossaries for product terms, brand names, and technical jargon ensuring consistency across 20-150+ locales
**Vendor Diversification**: Use multiple LSPs (2-3 vendors) for different language families and quality tiers preventing single-vendor dependency
**In-Country Review**: Engage in-country reviewers for market-specific validation of translations, cultural appropriateness, and local idioms
**Linguistic QA Scoring**: Implement LQA scoring (MQM, SAE J2450, DQF) measuring translation quality, completeness, and consistency
**Performance Metrics**: Track translation turnaround time, cost per word, LQA scores, locale revenue contribution, and user satisfaction by locale
**Legal Localization Priority**: Prioritize legal content (terms, privacy policy, regulatory disclosures) ensuring compliance before product launch
**Payment Localization**: Integrate local payment methods (Alipay, Boleto, iDEAL, SEPA) enabling higher conversion vs card-only approaches
**Cultural Adaptation**: Adapt imagery, colors, icons, and examples for cultural appropriateness in different markets
**RTL Language Testing**: Thoroughly test RTL locales (Arabic, Hebrew) ensuring layout mirroring, text direction, and UI element positioning
**Locale ROI Tracking**: Measure localization ROI through locale-specific revenue, user acquisition, conversion rates, and retention
**Incremental Translation**: Launch with 60-80% completion for high-priority features enabling faster market entry with iterative completion
**Community Translation**: Leverage community translators for less-resourced languages (African, Southeast Asian) with professional review
**Budget Planning**: Budget translation costs using per-word rates, word count extrapolation, and historical data enabling accurate forecasting
**Change Management**: Communicate locale launches, feature availability, and support availability to Sales, Marketing, and Customer Success teams
**Compliance Review**: Review localized content for regulatory compliance (GDPR notices, age ratings, disclaimers) with legal counsel
**Accessibility Standards**: Ensure localized content meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA across all locales for screen reader compatibility
