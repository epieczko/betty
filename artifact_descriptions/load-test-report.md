# Name: load-test-report

## Executive Summary

The Load Test Report provides comprehensive analysis of load testing execution using tools like JMeter, Gatling, k6, or Locust, documenting test configuration (concurrent users, ramp-up patterns, think times), performance metrics (response times, throughput, error rates), resource utilization, and bottleneck analysis. This artifact translates raw performance data into actionable insights for performance engineers, development teams, and capacity planners to understand system behavior under realistic user loads.

Load test reports go beyond raw metrics to provide context, analysis, and recommendations. They document test scenarios (login flows, search operations, checkout processes), explain observed behavior (why P99 latency spiked at 500 concurrent users), correlate application performance with infrastructure metrics (CPU saturation causing latency increases), and recommend specific optimizations (database query tuning, connection pool sizing, caching implementation).

### Strategic Importance

- **Performance Characterization**: Documents how system performs under concurrent user loads and sustained traffic patterns
- **Bottleneck Discovery**: Identifies performance bottlenecks through correlation of application metrics and infrastructure utilization
- **Capacity Validation**: Validates system can handle target user volumes with acceptable response times and error rates
- **Scalability Assessment**: Determines linear vs. non-linear scaling behavior and identifies scaling constraints
- **Production Readiness**: Provides evidence-based assessment of application readiness for production deployment
- **Optimization Roadmap**: Prioritizes performance improvements based on measured impact on user experience
- **Regression Prevention**: Establishes performance baseline for detecting regressions in future releases

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact analyzes load test execution results from JMeter, Gatling, k6, or similar tools, providing context on test configuration (user profiles, ramp-up patterns, think times), interpreting performance metrics (latency percentiles, throughput, errors), correlating application and infrastructure behavior, identifying bottlenecks, and recommending specific performance optimizations.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Test configuration: concurrent users, ramp-up strategy, duration, think times, geographic distribution
- Test scenario descriptions: user journeys (login, browse, search, checkout), transaction flows, data variations
- Performance metrics analysis: P50/P90/P95/P99 latencies, throughput (RPS/TPS), error rates by type
- Resource utilization correlation: CPU, memory, disk I/O, network bandwidth, connection pools
- Database performance analysis: query execution times, connection pool saturation, lock contention
- Application-level metrics: thread pool utilization, GC pause times, cache hit ratios
- Bottleneck identification: specific components, queries, or operations causing performance degradation
- Comparative analysis: performance across different load levels, comparison to baseline or previous tests
- Recommendations: specific, actionable optimizations with estimated impact

**Out of Scope**:
- Raw test execution data (covered in performance-test-results)
- Detailed test script implementation and automation code
- Long-term capacity planning models (covered in capacity-models)

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
