# Name: capacity-plan

## Executive Summary

The Capacity Plan is a strategic operational artifact that forecasts infrastructure resource requirements, establishes capacity targets, and defines scaling strategies to ensure systems meet current and future demand while optimizing costs. This plan applies data-driven capacity planning methodologies to predict growth patterns, identify capacity constraints before they impact performance, and guide investment decisions for compute, storage, network, and database resources.

As a foundational SRE deliverable, it translates business growth projections into infrastructure requirements through trend analysis, workload modeling, and resource utilization monitoring. The plan defines capacity thresholds, auto-scaling policies, horizontal and vertical scaling strategies, and provides actionable recommendations for infrastructure expansion aligned to demand forecasts and cost optimization goals.

### Strategic Importance

- **Cost Optimization**: Balances resource provisioning with actual demand to minimize waste and control cloud spending
- **Scalability Planning**: Defines horizontal and vertical scaling strategies for sustained growth and traffic spikes
- **Growth Enablement**: Ensures infrastructure capacity aligns with business growth trajectories and seasonal patterns
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Uses historical trends, utilization metrics, and forecasting models to guide investment

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
