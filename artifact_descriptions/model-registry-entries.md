# Name: model-registry-entries

## Executive Summary

The Model Registry Entries are structured metadata records in centralized model registries (MLflow, SageMaker Model Registry, Vertex AI Model Registry) that track model versions, deployment status, lineage, performance metrics, and approval history. These entries enable model lifecycle management, version control, deployment tracking, and audit trail for governance.

Model registry entries integrate MLOps platforms (MLflow, Kubeflow, SageMaker, Vertex AI) with model governance frameworks, providing single source of truth for model versions, lineage tracking from training data through deployment, stage transitions (staging, production, archived), and metadata including hyperparameters, metrics, tags, and signatures.

The entries enable ML Engineers to deploy and rollback model versions, Data Scientists to compare model experiments and select champion models, AI Governance Teams to track approval status and compliance metadata, and Model Risk Managers to audit model provenance and change history.

### Strategic Importance

- **Version Control**: Tracks all model versions with lineage from training run to deployment
- **Deployment Management**: Controls stage transitions (staging→production) with approval gates
- **Audit Trail**: Provides immutable history of model changes, approvals, and deployments
- **Rollback Capability**: Enables rapid rollback to previous model version in case of issues
- **Model Lineage**: Traces model ancestry from training data, code version, hyperparameters to predictions
- **Compliance Documentation**: Stores compliance metadata (risk tier, bias assessment, approval date) with model
- **Integration Hub**: Integrates model training (MLflow Tracking), deployment (Kubernetes), monitoring (Evidently AI)

## Best Practices

**Automated Registration**: Automatically register models from training pipelines; avoid manual registration
**Semantic Versioning**: Use MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning; increment MAJOR for breaking changes
**Complete Metadata**: Populate all metadata fields (tags, description, hyperparameters, metrics) at registration time
**Model Signature**: Always include model signature (input/output schema) for contract enforcement
**Immutable Versions**: Never modify registered model artifacts; create new version for changes
**Stage Transitions**: Require approval for production promotion; log approvers and approval date
**Model Aliases**: Use aliases (champion, challenger) instead of hardcoding version numbers in code
**Git Integration**: Tag model versions with Git commit SHA; enable code-to-model traceability
**Dataset Versioning**: Record dataset version (DVC, Delta Lake) used for training; link to model
**Comprehensive Tags**: Tag models with risk_tier, business_unit, use_case, owner, compliance_status
**Model Descriptions**: Write clear descriptions including use case, limitations, intended users
**Artifact Organization**: Store all model artifacts (preprocessor, encoder, model) as single package
**Environment Specification**: Include conda.yaml or requirements.txt for reproducible serving
**Lineage Tracking**: Log training run ID (MLflow run_id) for full lineage to hyperparameters and metrics
**Archive Old Versions**: Archive models after newer version deployed; set retention policies
**Monitoring Integration**: Configure webhooks to trigger monitoring setup on production promotion
**Deployment Metadata**: Record deployment endpoints, traffic allocation, and rollout strategy
**Rollback Plan**: Document rollback procedures; test rollback to previous version
**Access Control**: Implement RBAC for model registration, stage transitions, production promotion
**Audit Logging**: Enable audit logs for all model registry operations; retain for compliance

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
