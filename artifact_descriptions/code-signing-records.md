# Name: code-signing-records

## Executive Summary

The Code Signing Records artifact documents the usage of digital signatures to verify software authenticity, integrity, and publisher identity across platforms including Windows Authenticode, Apple Developer ID, Java jarsigner, Android APK signing, and container image signing with Sigstore Cosign. This artifact provides comprehensive audit trails of signing operations, certificate lifecycle management, timestamp authority usage, and signature verification workflows essential for establishing trust in software supply chains.

As a critical security control for software distribution, code signing records serve release engineers performing signing operations, security teams managing signing certificates, compliance officers demonstrating software provenance, and end users verifying software authenticity. Integration with tools like Sigstore (Cosign, Fulcio, Rekor), HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, AWS KMS, and HSM platforms ensures cryptographic key protection while maintaining detailed logs of certificate issuance, key usage, signature generation, and verification outcomes.

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact serves as authoritative documentation of code signing operations including certificate acquisition (EV, OV validation), private key protection (HSM, cloud KMS), signing workflows (automated CI/CD signing, manual signing ceremonies), timestamp authority usage (RFC 3161), and signature verification. It provides evidence of software authenticity, enables revocation response, supports incident investigation, and demonstrates compliance with software supply chain security requirements.

### Scope

**In Scope**:

## Best Practices

**HSM/Hardware Token Requirement**: Use FIPS 140-2 Level 2+ HSM or hardware token for EV Code Signing certificates (CA/Browser Forum requirement)
**Certificate Type Selection**: Use EV Code Signing for public distribution (avoids SmartScreen warnings); OV acceptable for internal/enterprise distribution
**Private Key Protection**: Never extract private keys from HSM; store in Azure Key Vault, AWS KMS, or hardware HSM; implement strict access controls
**Timestamp Always**: Always timestamp signatures with RFC 3161 compliant TSA; enables signature validation after certificate expiration
**Automated Signing**: Integrate signing into CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins) with HSM/KMS; avoid manual signing processes
**Certificate Lifecycle**: Track certificate expiration (typically 1-3 years); renew 30+ days before expiration; test new certificates before old ones expire
**Signature Verification**: Verify signatures immediately after signing; implement verification in deployment pipelines before distribution
**Multi-Platform Support**: Use appropriate tools per platform (signtool for Windows, codesign for macOS, jarsigner for Java, cosign for containers)
**Revocation Monitoring**: Monitor CRL/OCSP for certificate revocation; implement emergency revocation procedures; resign affected binaries immediately
**Dual Signing**: For Windows, dual-sign with SHA-1 (legacy) and SHA-256 (modern) for Windows 7-10 compatibility
**Certificate Pinning**: For high-security scenarios, implement certificate pinning in applications to prevent MITM attacks
**Audit Logging**: Log all signing operations (who, what, when, which certificate); retain logs per compliance requirements (typically 7+ years)
**Access Control**: Implement least privilege for signing operations; require MFA for HSM access; rotate credentials quarterly
**Signing Server Hardening**: Isolate signing infrastructure; disable unnecessary services; patch regularly; monitor for compromise
**SBOM Integration**: Sign SBOMs (CycloneDX, SPDX) alongside binaries; include dependency signatures in supply chain verification
**Cosign for Containers**: Use Sigstore Cosign for container signing; leverage keyless signing with OIDC; publish signatures to Rekor transparency log
**Signature Formats**: Use detached signatures for flexibility; embed signatures for convenience; support multiple signature formats where needed
**Emergency Procedures**: Document certificate compromise response; maintain revocation contact with CA; prepare rapid re-signing workflow

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
