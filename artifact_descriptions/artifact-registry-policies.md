# Name: artifact-registry-policies

## Executive Summary

The Artifact Registry Policies defines governance rules for managing container images, application packages, and build artifacts across JFrog Artifactory, Sonatype Nexus, GitHub Packages, and cloud-native registries (ECR, GCR, ACR). This policy establishes retention rules, vulnerability scanning requirements, promotion workflows, and access controls that support continuous delivery pipelines while maintaining security posture and reducing storage costs.

In modern DevOps practices, artifact registries serve as the central source of truth for deployable packages, enabling teams to achieve deployment frequencies of 10-100x per day with change failure rates below 5%. This policy ensures consistency across microservices architectures, enables reliable environment promotion (Dev to Staging to Prod), and provides audit trails for compliance requirements (SOC 2, ISO 27001). By implementing quantitative metrics such as artifact retention policies (keep last 10 versions or 90 days) and automated vulnerability gates (block Critical/High CVEs), organizations reduce storage costs by 40-60% while improving security incident response time from days to hours.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact establishes mandatory governance policies for all artifact registries used in the software delivery lifecycle. It defines retention rules, access controls, vulnerability scanning requirements, artifact promotion workflows, and naming conventions that ensure secure, traceable, and cost-effective artifact management. The policy enables teams to implement immutable infrastructure principles while maintaining auditability and compliance across container registries (Docker Hub, ECR, GCR, ACR, Harbor), package repositories (npm, PyPI, Maven Central, NuGet), and binary artifact stores (JFrog Artifactory, Sonatype Nexus, GitHub Packages).

### Scope

## Best Practices

**Immutable Artifact Tags**: Never overwrite existing artifact versions; use immutable tags (SHA256 digests) for production deployments to ensure reproducibility
**Retention by Recency**: Keep last 10 versions per artifact OR last 90 days, whichever retains more; automatically prune older versions to reduce storage costs by 40-60%
**Vulnerability Scanning Gates**: Block deployment of artifacts with Critical or High severity CVEs; scan all artifacts on push and daily for newly disclosed vulnerabilities using Trivy, Snyk, or Aqua
**Semantic Versioning**: Enforce SemVer 2.0 (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for all artifacts; use pre-release identifiers (1.2.3-rc.1, 1.2.3-dev) for non-production versions
**Environment-Specific Repositories**: Separate registries or repositories for Dev, Staging, and Production; artifacts promoted through environments never skip stages
**Automated Promotion Workflows**: Use CI/CD pipelines (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins) to promote artifacts; require quality gates (tests pass, no high CVEs, signed artifacts)
**Artifact Signing**: Sign all production artifacts using Sigstore/Cosign, Notary, or GPG; verify signatures before deployment to prevent supply chain attacks
**Access Control by Least Privilege**: Grant pull access broadly, push access restrictively; use service accounts with scoped permissions for CI/CD pipelines
**Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Log all registry operations (push, pull, delete, tag) with user/service account, timestamp, and IP; retain logs for 365 days minimum for compliance
**Multi-Region Replication**: Replicate critical artifacts to multiple geographic regions for disaster recovery and reduced latency; test failover procedures quarterly
**Cost Optimization through Deduplication**: Enable layer deduplication for container registries; use repository proxies (Artifactory, Nexus) to cache external dependencies
**Registry Health Monitoring**: Track registry availability (99.9% SLO), pull latency (p95 < 500ms), and storage growth; alert on SLO violations or capacity thresholds
**Disaster Recovery Testing**: Quarterly test registry backup restoration and failover procedures; document RTO of 4 hours and RPO of 1 hour for critical artifacts
**Namespace Organization**: Use hierarchical naming (org/team/artifact-name) for large organizations; enforce naming conventions via admission webhooks or CI checks
**External Dependency Proxying**: Cache external artifacts (Docker Hub, npm, Maven Central) in internal registries; reduces external dependency risks and improves build reliability
**Artifact Metadata Tagging**: Tag artifacts with git commit SHA, build number, environment, and timestamp; enables traceability from deployed artifact back to source code
**Storage Quota Management**: Set per-team or per-project storage quotas; alert teams at 80% utilization and block pushes at 100% to prevent storage exhaustion
**Registry Security Hardening**: Enable TLS 1.2+ for all connections, disable anonymous pull access, rotate credentials quarterly, and conduct annual penetration testing
**Promotion Quality Gates**: Require passing tests (unit, integration, E2E), successful security scans, and manual approval for production promotions
**Artifact Bill of Materials**: Generate and store SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) for all artifacts; enables rapid response to zero-day vulnerabilities
**Deprecation Policies**: Mark deprecated artifacts with labels; provide 90-day notice before removal; redirect consumers to replacement artifacts
**Performance Baselines**: Establish baseline metrics for pull latency by artifact size and region; investigate degradations exceeding 20% of baseline
**Change Management Integration**: Link artifact promotions to change tickets (ServiceNow, Jira); ensures compliance with change control procedures

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
