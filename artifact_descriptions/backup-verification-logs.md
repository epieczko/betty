# Name: backup-verification-logs

## Executive Summary

The Backup Verification Logs is a critical operational and compliance artifact that provides structured evidence of backup integrity testing and recovery readiness validation. This comprehensive log documents all backup verification activities including restore tests, integrity checks, encryption validation, and recovery time objective (RTO) measurements across production and disaster recovery environments.

As a cornerstone of business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR) programs, this artifact enables organizations to demonstrate backup reliability, meet regulatory retention requirements, and maintain recovery confidence. It provides auditors, compliance teams, and technical operations with verifiable proof that backup systems can successfully restore data when needed.

### Strategic Importance

- **Recovery Assurance**: Validates that backups are restorable and meet recovery objectives before disasters occur
- **Compliance Evidence**: Demonstrates adherence to SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, and financial services backup requirements
- **Audit Readiness**: Provides comprehensive audit trail for backup testing frequency and success rates
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifies backup failures, corruption, or gaps before they impact business operations
- **SLA Validation**: Tracks actual recovery times against contracted RTOs and recovery point objectives (RPOs)

## Purpose & Scope

## Best Practices

**Verification Frequency**: Test full restores monthly for critical systems, quarterly for standard systems, annually for archived data
**3-2-1-1-0 Rule**: Maintain 3 copies on 2 media types with 1 off-site, 1 immutable/air-gapped, and 0 errors
**Automated Validation**: Use backup software built-in verification (Veeam SureBackup, Commvault IntelliSnap validation)
**Restore Testing Rotation**: Test different systems each cycle to achieve 100% coverage annually without overwhelming operations
**RTO/RPO Measurement**: Document actual recovery times vs. SLA targets; escalate gaps exceeding 20% variance
**Encryption Validation**: Verify backup encryption at rest and in transit; test key recovery procedures quarterly
**Immutable Backups**: Implement immutable snapshots or object lock for ransomware protection (14-90 day retention)
**Off-Site Replication**: Maintain geo-redundant backups with minimum 100-mile separation from primary site
**Database Consistency**: Use application-consistent backups (VSS, Oracle RMAN, SQL Server VSS Writer)
**Incremental Testing**: Validate incremental/differential chains monthly to ensure complete restore paths
**Deduplication Verification**: Monitor deduplication ratios (target 10:1 to 20:1); investigate significant deviations
**Tape Media Rotation**: Test tape readability quarterly; retire media after 2-3 years or per manufacturer guidelines
**Cloud Backup Validation**: Verify cross-region replication for AWS/Azure/GCP backups; test restore from each region
**Retention Compliance**: Automate retention policy enforcement (7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly, 7 yearly is common)
**Failure Documentation**: Log all backup failures with root cause analysis; track Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR)
**Performance Baselines**: Establish backup window baselines; alert on backup jobs exceeding 125% of baseline duration
**Ransomware Drills**: Conduct quarterly simulated ransomware recovery tests using isolated restore environments
**Backup Chain Integrity**: Validate full backup chains before aging out full backups; prevent orphaned incrementals
**Change Management**: Document all backup infrastructure changes; require verification testing post-change
**Audit Trail Retention**: Maintain backup logs for minimum 1 year (3-7 years for regulated industries)
**Dashboard Metrics**: Track backup success rate (target >99%), average RTO/RPO, and storage efficiency trends
**Third-Party Verification**: Consider independent verification services for critical compliance requirements
**Documentation Standards**: Use structured formats (JSON, CSV, or backup software native formats) for automated parsing
**Alerting Thresholds**: Configure proactive alerts for backup failures, performance degradation, and capacity warnings
**Version Control**: Store verification logs in version-controlled repository with cryptographic hash verification
