# Name: change-log

## Executive Summary

The Change Log artifact provides a chronological audit trail documenting all modifications, decisions, issues, and resolutions throughout program and project lifecycles. Enterprise change logs leverage tracking systems (Jira, ServiceNow Change Management, Azure DevOps), version control platforms (Git, SVN), and governance platforms (Monday.com, Smartsheet) to maintain comprehensive 250-500+ entry records capturing timestamps, change types, impacted components, approvers, and implementation status.

Modern change management practices align with ITIL 4 Change Enablement, ISO 20000-1 Service Management, and COBIT 2019 BAI06 (Managed Changes) to reduce change-related incidents 40-60%, improve audit readiness, and demonstrate governance rigor. Change logs support post-implementation reviews, root cause analysis, trend identification, and continuous improvement by preserving institutional knowledge beyond personnel tenure.

Organizations with mature change logging reduce regulatory audit findings 35-50%, accelerate incident resolution 30-45% through historical context, and demonstrate SOC 2 CC8.1 (change tracking) compliance. Change logs provide critical inputs for lessons learned repositories, risk assessments, and governance reporting while satisfying FDA 21 CFR Part 11, GxP, and ISO 13485 traceability requirements for regulated industries.

### Strategic Importance

- **Governance Excellence**: Demonstrates rigorous change control aligned with ITIL 4, ISO 20000-1, and organizational governance frameworks
- **Risk Mitigation**: Enables pattern analysis identifying recurring issues, reducing change-related incidents 40-60% through proactive intervention
- **Audit Readiness**: Provides comprehensive audit trails for SOC 2, ISO certifications, FDA inspections, and regulatory examinations
- **Knowledge Capture**: Preserves institutional knowledge through complete decision histories, rationales, and outcomes documentation
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables data-driven process improvements through trend analysis, post-implementation reviews, and lessons learned synthesis
- **Incident Response**: Accelerates troubleshooting 30-45% by providing historical context for similar past issues and resolutions

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact serves as the definitive chronological record of all changes, decisions, issues, and resolutions affecting program scope, schedule, budget, architecture, or deliverables. It enables transparency through complete visibility into what changed, when, why, who approved it, and what resulted. The change log supports accountability by documenting decision-makers and rationales, facilitates lessons learned through analyzable historical patterns, and ensures audit compliance by providing auditable trails satisfying SOC 2 CC8.1, ISO 27001 A.12.1.2, and regulatory requirements.

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
