# Name: interface-control-document

## Executive Summary

The Interface Control Document (ICD) is a comprehensive technical specification that defines the contract, protocols, message formats, data models, and integration requirements between two or more systems, services, or components. This artifact serves as the authoritative reference for API contracts (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, SOAP), event schemas (Kafka, RabbitMQ, EventBridge), message queue protocols, database integration interfaces, and third-party system integrations.

As the foundation for integration governance and contract-first development, the ICD documents complete technical specifications including OpenAPI 3.1/AsyncAPI schemas, request/response payloads, authentication mechanisms (OAuth 2.0, mTLS, API keys), error handling, retry policies, SLA commitments (latency, throughput, availability), and data validation rules. It enables decoupled development by establishing clear boundaries between systems, supports integration testing through precise contract definitions, and provides the basis for consumer-driven contracts and API governance.

### Strategic Importance

- **Integration Contracts**: Establishes explicit agreements between service providers and consumers preventing integration failures
- **Decoupled Development**: Enables parallel development of interconnected systems through clear interface specifications
- **Change Management**: Provides baseline for assessing impact of interface changes and managing version transitions
- **Quality Assurance**: Supports contract testing, mock service generation, and integration validation
- **Operational SLAs**: Documents performance commitments, availability targets, and support escalation procedures
- **Vendor Management**: Formalizes integration requirements for third-party systems and partner APIs
- **Compliance & Audit**: Provides evidence of interface controls for security, privacy, and regulatory audits

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This document establishes the complete technical specification for integration interfaces between systems, defining the contract that both provider and consumer must adhere to for successful integration. It solves the coordination problem in distributed systems by documenting protocols, message formats, data semantics, error conditions, and operational commitments, enabling teams to develop and test integrations independently while ensuring compatibility at integration time.

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
