# Name: non-functional-requirements-matrix

## Executive Summary

The Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Matrix is a comprehensive quality attribute specification that defines measurable performance, scalability, reliability, security, usability, and maintainability requirements following ISO 25010 (SQuaRE) quality model standards. This structured matrix documents quantifiable NFRs with specific metrics, thresholds, measurement methods, and validation criteria, ensuring system quality attributes are explicitly specified, prioritized, and testable.

Created using quality frameworks including FURPS+, ISO 25010, and quality attribute scenarios, this artifact systematically captures NFRs across eight quality characteristics: performance efficiency (response time, throughput, capacity), reliability (availability, MTBF, MTTR), security (authentication, authorization, encryption), usability (learnability, accessibility), maintainability (modularity, testability), portability (platform independence), compatibility (interoperability), and scalability (horizontal/vertical scaling). Managed in requirements platforms like Jira, Azure DevOps, or DOORS Next, the NFR Matrix ensures quality attributes receive equal rigor as functional requirements throughout system development.

### Strategic Importance

- **Complexity Management**: Simplifies multidimensional analysis into digestible visual format
- **Gap Analysis**: Rapidly identifies coverage gaps, redundancies, or misalignments
- **Decision Support**: Provides structured framework for evaluating options and trade-offs
- **Communication Excellence**: Enables consistent understanding across diverse stakeholder groups
- **Accountability**: Clearly defines ownership and responsibilities across dimensions

**Testability**: Ensure each NFR is testable with defined test method (load testing, security scanning, usability testing)
**Priority Classification**: Categorize NFRs by priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low) for architecture trade-offs
**Architecture Impact**: Assess architecture implications of each NFR during requirements analysis phase
**Benchmarking**: Reference industry benchmarks and competitor performance as validation criteria
**Trade-off Analysis**: Document trade-offs between conflicting NFRs (e.g., performance vs. security)
**Technology Constraints**: Identify NFRs that constrain technology choices (e.g., platform requirements)
**Monitoring Strategy**: Define how each NFR will be monitored in production (APM tools, dashboards, alerts)
**Load Profiles**: Specify expected load patterns (concurrent users, TPS, data volumes) for capacity planning
**Security Standards**: Reference security frameworks (OWASP, CIS Controls, NIST) for security NFRs

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
