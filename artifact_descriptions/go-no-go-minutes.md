# Name: go-no-go-minutes

## Executive Summary

The Go/No-Go Meeting Minutes artifact documents the final launch decision meeting where stakeholders formally decide whether to proceed with production deployment (GO) or postpone/cancel (NO-GO). This critical decision gate reviews launch readiness criteria, release certification status, risk assessment findings, stakeholder sign-offs, operational readiness, and rollback plan validation before authorizing production release.

Go/No-Go meetings integrate with deployment readiness reviews, ITIL 4 Release Management, and Change Advisory Board (CAB) processes. They evaluate release certification evidence, validate that quality gates passed, confirm operational readiness (monitoring, runbooks, on-call), assess risk mitigation effectiveness, and document the formal GO or NO-GO decision with clear rationale. This artifact provides accountability, stakeholder alignment, and audit trails for high-stakes deployment decisions, particularly for major releases, high-risk changes, and customer-impacting deployments.

### Strategic Importance

- **Launch Decision Authority**: Documents formal GO or NO-GO decision with clear accountability and decision rationale
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensures unanimous agreement among engineering, operations, security, product, and executive stakeholders
- **Risk Acceptance**: Validates risk mitigation strategies and documents accepted residual risks before deployment
- **Rollback Readiness**: Confirms rollback plan tested, rollback authority assigned, and rollback triggers defined
- **Operational Readiness**: Validates monitoring dashboards, runbooks, on-call schedules, and incident response prepared
- **Quality Gate Validation**: Reviews release certification evidence confirming all quality gates passed
- **Compliance Documentation**: Provides deployment authorization audit trail for SOC 2, ISO 27001, regulatory requirements

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

Go/No-Go meeting minutes document the final launch decision meeting, reviewing launch readiness criteria, validating stakeholder sign-offs, assessing risk acceptance, confirming operational readiness, and recording the formal GO or NO-GO decision with rationale for production deployment authorization.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Meeting logistics (date/time, attendees, roles, decision-makers, meeting facilitator)
- Launch readiness criteria review (checklist-based evaluation of go-live requirements)
- Release certification status (quality gates passed, security scans cleared, performance validated)
- Risk assessment findings (FMEA scores, blast radius, mitigation strategies, residual risk acceptance)
- Stakeholder sign-offs (engineering, operations, security, product, executive confirmation)
- Operational readiness validation (monitoring dashboards, runbooks, on-call schedule, incident response)
- Rollback plan confirmation (rollback tested, rollback authority assigned, rollback triggers defined)
- Dependency readiness (third-party services available, API compatibility confirmed, infrastructure provisioned)
- Communication plan validation (internal notifications, customer communications, status page updates)
- Final GO or NO-GO decision (formal vote, unanimous vs majority decision, decision rationale)
- NO-GO conditions for resubmission (blocking issues requiring resolution, timeline for readiness)
- GO conditions and caveats (conditional approval requiring specific actions during/after deployment)
- Action items and owners (tasks to complete before deployment, post-deployment validation tasks)
- Deployment timing confirmation (approved deployment window, deployment start time, expected duration)
- Post-deployment validation criteria (success metrics, smoke test checklist, monitoring thresholds)

**Out of Scope**:
- Detailed release certification checklist (handled by release-certification.md)
- Comprehensive risk assessment methodology (handled by release-risk-assessment.md)
- CAB approval workflow and voting records (handled by cab-approvals.md)

## Best Practices

**Checklist-Based Evaluation**: Use standardized launch readiness checklist to ensure consistent evaluation across releases
**Objective Criteria**: Define measurable GO criteria (e.g., zero critical bugs, 80%+ code coverage, p95 latency < 200ms)
**Stakeholder Presence**: Require key decision-makers present (engineering lead, SRE lead, product director minimum)
**Pre-Read Distribution**: Distribute readiness materials 24 hours before meeting for stakeholder review
**Time-Boxed Meeting**: Limit go/no-go meeting to 60 minutes with clear agenda and decision deadline
**Evidence-Based Decision**: Base GO decision on objective evidence (test reports, risk scores, certification status)
**Unanimous vs Majority**: Require unanimous GO decision from key stakeholders; any NO-GO blocks deployment
**Document Dissent**: If GO proceeds with concerns, document dissenting opinions and residual risks
**NO-GO Exit Criteria**: Clearly define what must be resolved for resubmission if NO-GO decision made
**Rollback Validation**: Confirm rollback actually tested in staging, not just theoretically documented
**On-Call Confirmation**: Verify on-call engineer present in meeting or explicitly briefed on deployment
**Communication Plan**: Validate stakeholder notification plan and customer communication prepared
**War Room Bridge**: Establish launch bridge/war room details for real-time deployment coordination
**Success Metrics**: Define specific success metrics for post-deployment validation (not vague "monitor system")
**Rollback Timeline**: Establish decision timeline for rollback (e.g., "decide within 2 hours post-deployment")
**Conditional GO Clarity**: If conditional GO, document explicit conditions and validation criteria
**Action Item Tracking**: Assign owners and due dates for all action items; track to completion
**Decision Rationale**: Document WHY GO or NO-GO decision made, not just the outcome
**Audit Trail**: Capture meeting recording or detailed notes for compliance audit trail
**Post-Deployment Review**: Schedule follow-up review 24-48 hours post-deployment to validate decision accuracy

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
