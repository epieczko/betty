# Name: experiment-tracking-logs

## Executive Summary

The Experiment Tracking Logs is a comprehensive system for recording, monitoring, and analyzing A/B tests, multivariate experiments, and feature rollout experiments across platforms like Optimizely, VWO, Amplitude Experiment, LaunchDarkly Experimentation, and Google Optimize. This artifact provides a complete audit trail of experiment configurations, variant assignments, metric calculations, statistical significance testing, and business decisions driven by experimentation.

As experimentation becomes central to product development, maintaining rigorous experiment logs is essential for statistical validity, reproducibility, and organizational learning. This artifact captures experiment hypotheses, success metrics, sample sizes, power analysis, statistical significance results (p-values <0.05), confidence intervals, minimum detectable effects (MDE), and both Bayesian and Frequentist analysis approaches. It enables data-driven decision-making while preventing common pitfalls like p-hacking, peeking, and Simpson's paradox.

## Best Practices

**Pre-Registration**: Document experiment hypothesis, metrics, and analysis plan before launching to prevent p-hacking
**Power Analysis**: Calculate required sample size to detect MDE with 80% power and 5% significance level before starting
**Single Primary Metric**: Define one primary decision metric to avoid multiple comparison issues; secondary metrics for learning only
**Guardrail Metrics**: Monitor key business metrics (revenue, retention, engagement) to detect unintended negative impacts
**Statistical Significance**: Use p < 0.05 threshold for significance; require 95% confidence intervals that exclude zero
**Minimum Duration**: Run experiments for at least 1-2 weeks to capture weekly seasonality and reduce novelty effects
**Sample Ratio Mismatch**: Check for SRM (chi-square test on assignment ratios) to detect instrumentation bugs
**AA Testing**: Validate experiment platform with AA tests (identical variants) to ensure no false positive rate inflation
**Peeking Prevention**: Use sequential testing methods (SPRT) or wait for predetermined sample size before analysis
**Effect Size Reporting**: Report both statistical significance and practical significance (lift percentage, absolute impact)
**Segment Analysis**: Examine treatment effects across key segments but correct for multiple comparisons
**Confidence Intervals**: Always report confidence intervals, not just p-values, for interpretability
**Bayesian Alternative**: Consider Bayesian methods for faster convergence and direct probability statements
**Heterogeneous Effects**: Investigate whether treatment effects differ across user segments or contexts
**Long-Term Holdouts**: Maintain small holdout groups for measuring long-term effects beyond experiment duration
**Documentation Standards**: Include hypothesis, success criteria, variants, traffic allocation, duration, results, decision
**Experiment Naming**: Use consistent naming (team-feature-hypothesis-date) for discoverability and organization
**Reproducibility**: Store experiment configs, random seeds, and analysis code for complete reproducibility
**Meta-Analysis**: Tag experiments by theme to enable meta-analysis across related experiments
**Negative Results**: Document and share negative experiment results to prevent duplicate efforts
**Launch Criteria**: Establish clear launch criteria (e.g., 3% lift, p<0.05, no guardrail violations) before experiment starts
**Instrumentation Validation**: Verify metrics are logging correctly before ramping to full traffic
**Ramp Plan**: For high-risk experiments, ramp gradually (1%, 5%, 25%, 50%, 100%) with checkpoints

   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
