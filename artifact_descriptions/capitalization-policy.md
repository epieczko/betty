# Name: capitalization-policy

## Executive Summary

The Capitalization Policy is a formal accounting policy that establishes rules, thresholds, and procedures for determining when expenditures should be capitalized as assets versus expensed immediately. This critical financial governance artifact ensures compliance with GAAP (ASC 350-40), IFRS, and SOX requirements while providing clear guidance for capitalizing software development costs, cloud implementation costs, and technology infrastructure investments.

As a cornerstone of financial compliance and accurate financial reporting, this policy defines specific criteria for capitalizing internal-use software, R&D expenditures, cloud migration costs, and IT projects. It establishes minimum capitalization thresholds (typically $5K-$25K), useful life assumptions for depreciation/amortization, and documentation requirements to support audit trails. The policy directly impacts balance sheet composition, EBITDA calculations, earnings quality, and tax treatment of technology investments.

### Strategic Importance

- **GAAP/IFRS Compliance**: Ensures adherence to ASC 350-40 (internal-use software), ASC 985-20 (software for sale), and IAS 38 (intangible assets)
- **Financial Statement Accuracy**: Drives correct classification of costs between CapEx (balance sheet) and OpEx (income statement)
- **SOX Compliance**: Establishes internal controls over financial reporting for technology expenditures subject to Section 404 requirements
- **Tax Optimization**: Maximizes tax benefits through proper timing of deductions, R&D tax credits, and depreciation schedules
- **EBITDA Management**: Impacts reported EBITDA through capitalization of development costs (adding back amortization)
- **Audit Defense**: Provides documented rationale and controls to support external audit, SEC filings, and tax examinations
- **Capital Allocation**: Enables accurate tracking of capital deployed in technology assets versus operational spending

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This policy provides mandatory guidance for:
- **GAAP/IFRS Rules**: Application of FASB ASC 350-40 (internal-use software) and ASC 985-20 (software for sale)
- **Software Development Capitalization**: Criteria for capitalizing application development, preliminary phase vs implementation
- **R&D Expense vs Capitalize**: Distinction between research costs (expense) and development costs (potentially capitalize)
- **Capitalization Thresholds**: Minimum dollar amounts ($5K, $10K, $25K) and useful life requirements (typically >1 year)
- **Cloud Implementation Costs**: Treatment of SaaS implementation, hosting setup, and configuration costs per ASC 350-40
- **Useful Life & Amortization**: Standard useful lives (3-7 years for software) and amortization methods (straight-line)
- **Documentation Requirements**: Project tracking, labor capitalization timesheets, phase gate approvals
- **Impairment Testing**: Annual review for indicators of impairment and write-down requirements

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Internal-use software development (custom applications, platforms, infrastructure software)
- Software purchased for internal use (license costs, implementation, customization)
- Cloud implementation costs (SaaS setup, configuration, data migration)

- Capitalized labor costs (employee and contractor time during application development stage)
- Capitalized interest on software projects (if applicable)
- Hardware and infrastructure (servers, network, datacenter buildouts)
- Useful life determination and amortization schedules
- Impairment assessment and write-off procedures
- Controls and approval workflows for capitalization decisions

**Out of Scope**:
- Operating expense classification (covered in expense policy)
- Detailed project accounting procedures (covered in project accounting guidelines)
- Revenue recognition policies
- Inventory or fixed asset policies (unless technology-related)
- Lease accounting (ASC 842/IFRS 16)
