# Name: promotion-workflows

## Executive Summary

The Promotion Workflows artifact documents automated environment promotion processes for progressing code, configuration, infrastructure, and data artifacts through development, staging, and production environments. This artifact specifies GitOps-based promotion workflows using Argo CD, Flux CD, or Jenkins X, manual approval gates, automated testing requirements, rollback procedures, and change management integration for safe, reliable production deployments.

As organizations adopt GitOps patterns and infrastructure-as-code, this artifact serves Platform Engineers implementing automated promotion pipelines, DevOps Engineers configuring approval workflows, Release Managers coordinating production deployments, and SRE Teams ensuring deployment safety and rollback capability. It transforms ad-hoc promotion processes into standardized, auditable workflows with automated quality gates, security scanning, and compliance validation at each promotion stage.

### Strategic Importance

- **GitOps Automation**: Implements declarative environment promotion using Argo CD, Flux CD, or Jenkins X with Git as source of truth
- **Environment Progression**: Defines promotion path (dev → staging → production) with automated and manual gates at each stage
- **Approval Workflows**: Specifies approval requirements (peer review, tech lead approval, change advisory board), ServiceNow integration for change tickets
- **Quality Gates**: Implements automated gates including test pass rates, code coverage thresholds, security scan results, performance benchmarks
- **Progressive Delivery**: Enables canary deployments, blue/green switches, feature flag rollouts, traffic shifting strategies
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains complete deployment history, approval evidence, rollback records for compliance and troubleshooting
- **Rollback Capability**: Documents automated and manual rollback procedures, maintains previous deployment state, defines rollback SLAs

## Best Practices

**GitOps Pattern**: Use Git as single source of truth, all promotions via pull requests, maintain environment-specific branches/overlays
**Progressive Promotion**: Promote through dev → staging → production sequentially, require successful validation at each stage
**Automated Validation**: Implement comprehensive automated testing at each promotion gate, fail fast on quality issues
**Manual Approvals**: Require explicit approval for production promotions, implement four-eyes principle, document approval criteria
**Immutable Artifacts**: Promote same Docker image/artifact across environments, only change configuration/secrets
**Canary Deployments**: Start with small percentage traffic, monitor metrics, gradually increase or rollback
**Rollback Readiness**: Test rollback procedures regularly, maintain previous deployment state, automate rollback triggers
**Change Windows**: Define approved deployment windows for production, implement emergency change procedures
**Audit Logging**: Log all promotion activities, approval decisions, deployment outcomes, rollback events
**Notification Strategy**: Alert stakeholders at key promotion milestones, escalate on failures, provide deployment status visibility
**Environment Consistency**: Use infrastructure-as-code to ensure environment parity, minimize configuration drift
**Deployment Frequency**: Optimize for frequent small deployments over large infrequent releases, reduce blast radius
**Smoke Testing**: Run automated smoke tests immediately post-deployment, validate critical paths before declaring success

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
