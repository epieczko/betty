# Name: safety-filter-configurations

## Executive Summary

The Safety Filter Configurations artifact defines content moderation policies, toxicity thresholds, PII detection rules, and jailbreak prevention mechanisms for AI systems and user-generated content platforms. This artifact specifies configurations for safety APIs like Perspective API, Azure Content Safety, AWS Comprehend, OpenAI Moderation API, and custom safety classifiers that protect users from harmful content, prevent model misuse, and ensure regulatory compliance.

As AI systems become more powerful and user-facing, content safety becomes critical for user trust, legal compliance, and brand reputation. This artifact establishes toxicity score thresholds (typically 0.7-0.9 for production filtering), PII patterns for detection and redaction (SSN, credit cards, phone numbers), jailbreak detection patterns that identify adversarial prompts, and multi-layer defense strategies including input filtering, output filtering, and constitutional AI principles. It balances safety requirements with false positive rates to maintain user experience while preventing harmful content.

## Best Practices

**Start Conservative**: Begin with strict thresholds (0.8-0.9) and relax based on false positive data, not vice versa
**Multi-Layer Defense**: Implement both input and output filtering; never rely on single layer
**Monitor False Positives**: Track and review false positive cases to tune thresholds appropriately
**Context-Aware Filtering**: Adjust thresholds based on context (public vs. private, user demographics)
**Fail Safe**: On API failures, default to safe behavior (block on uncertainty or defer to human review)
**PII Detection Priority**: Always scan for PII before any other processing or storage
**Log Filtered Content**: Log filtered content (with appropriate security) for appeals and model improvement
**Human Review Escalation**: Define clear escalation paths for borderline cases to human moderators
**Appeal Process**: Provide users ability to appeal filtered content with transparent review process
**Regular Red Teaming**: Conduct regular adversarial testing to discover new jailbreak patterns
**Ensemble Scoring**: Combine multiple safety APIs for higher accuracy and coverage
**Latency Budgets**: Balance safety filtering latency (<100ms) with user experience
**A/B Test Thresholds**: Use A/B testing to optimize threshold values for best balance of safety and UX
**Cultural Sensitivity**: Customize filters for regional and cultural contexts, not one-size-fits-all
**Version Control Filters**: Track all filter configuration changes with rollback capability
**Transparency**: Communicate to users when content is filtered and provide reasons
**Continuous Improvement**: Regularly retrain custom classifiers with new examples
**Differential Filtering**: Apply stricter filters for high-risk contexts (minors, public posts)
**Whitelist Exceptions**: Maintain whitelists for educational, medical, and legitimate use cases
**Performance Monitoring**: Track filter latency, error rates, and availability continuously
**Incident Response**: Define procedures for handling safety filter bypasses or failures

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
