# Name: architecture-review-board-minutes

## Executive Summary

The Architecture Review Board (ARB) Minutes document the proceedings, discussions, and decisions of formal ARB meetings where architectural proposals are reviewed, evaluated, and approved or rejected. This governance record ensures transparency, accountability, and traceability for all architectural decisions made by the board, following TOGAF 9.2 Architecture Governance principles and COBIT 2019 governance frameworks.

These minutes capture quorum verification, attendee roles, proposals presented (with submitter and architectural context), discussion highlights, voting outcomes, approval conditions, exception grants with compensating controls, and action items with assigned owners. The minutes reference the ARB charter for decision-making authority, document appeals process for rejected proposals, and track compliance with established decision criteria including alignment with enterprise architecture principles, quality attribute requirements (ISO 25010), security standards (NIST CSF, Zero Trust), and cloud governance frameworks (AWS/Azure/GCP Well-Architected).

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Best Practices

**Pre-Meeting Preparation**: Distribute proposal materials 48-72 hours before meeting; require submitters to complete standardized proposal template with architecture diagrams, quality attribute scenarios, and compliance mapping
**Quorum Verification**: Start each meeting with roll call and quorum verification per ARB charter; document voting vs. non-voting attendees; postpone decisions if quorum not met
**Standardized Template**: Use consistent minutes template with sections: attendees, quorum status, proposals reviewed, discussions, decisions, action items, appeals; enable easy scanning and comparison
**Real-Time Documentation**: Assign dedicated scribe (rotating role) to document minutes during meeting; use collaborative tools (Confluence, Google Docs) for simultaneous editing and review
**Decision Recording**: Capture exact voting counts (e.g., "Approved 6-1-2: 6 for, 1 against, 2 abstentions"); document dissenting opinions and concerns for transparency
**Action Item Tracking**: Record each action item with SMART criteria - owner name/role, specific deliverable, measurable success criteria, due date; assign unique tracking ID
**Timely Distribution**: Publish draft minutes within 24 hours of meeting; circulate to attendees for review; finalize and publish within 48 hours with "FINAL" designation
**Linked Documentation**: Hyperlink to proposal documents, architecture diagrams, related ADRs, previous minutes, and referenced standards; enables easy navigation and context
**Confidentiality Management**: Mark sensitive sections appropriately; maintain separate confidential appendix if needed; control access based on information classification
**Immutable Records**: Once finalized, mark minutes as read-only; any corrections require separate erratum document; maintain complete audit trail
**Consistent Numbering**: Use sequential meeting numbers (ARB-2025-001, ARB-2025-002) and sequential proposal IDs (PROP-2025-001) for easy reference and tracking
**Decision Summaries**: Include concise executive summary at top of minutes highlighting key decisions and action items; enables quick review without reading full document
**Appeals Documentation**: When proposals are rejected, explicitly document appeals process, timeline, and escalation path; reference ARB charter sections
**Compliance Tagging**: Tag minutes with relevant compliance frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR) for audit trail; maintain cross-reference index
**Follow-Up Tracking**: Start each meeting with review of previous action items; update status; escalate overdue items to responsible parties and their management
**Voting Record Preservation**: For controversial decisions, capture individual votes by name (with member consent) or role; document any conflicts of interest and recusals
**Quality Attribute Verification**: Ensure decisions include measurable quality criteria; reference ISO 25010 attributes and SEI scenario format
**Technology Radar Sync**: Update organizational technology radar based on ARB decisions; move technologies between adopt/trial/assess/hold quadrants
**Search Optimization**: Use consistent terminology and keywords; tag with metadata (technology names, pattern names, decision types); enable full-text search across all minutes
**Retention Compliance**: Archive minutes per organizational retention policy (typically 7-10 years); maintain in multiple formats (source, PDF) for long-term accessibility
**Lessons Learned**: Quarterly review of ARB decisions and outcomes; assess prediction accuracy; update decision criteria and review process based on retrospectives

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
