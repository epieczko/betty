# Name: key-ceremony-records

## Executive Summary

The Key Ceremony Records artifact documents formal, witnessed procedures for generating, backing up, and managing cryptographic key material for critical PKI operations including root CA key generation, HSM initialization, key escrow, and disaster recovery. This artifact provides comprehensive audit trails of key ceremony execution following industry standards for split knowledge, dual control, M-of-N threshold schemes, and witness attestation required for Certificate Authority operations and high-assurance cryptographic systems.

As a critical security control for PKI and cryptographic infrastructure, key ceremony records serve PKI administrators performing root CA operations, security teams implementing cryptographic key governance, auditors verifying compliance with WebTrust for CAs and Common Criteria standards, and disaster recovery teams executing key restoration procedures. Integration with FIPS 140-2/3 validated HSMs (SafeNet Luna, Thales nShield, AWS CloudHSM, YubiHSM) ensures tamper-evident key generation and storage while comprehensive ceremony documentation provides legal defensibility and regulatory compliance evidence.

## Best Practices

**Ceremony Scripts**: Develop detailed ceremony scripts with numbered steps, checkpoints, and rollback procedures; peer-review scripts before execution
**Rehearsal Required**: Conduct full rehearsal of ceremony with dummy keys; validate all procedures, equipment, and timings before production ceremony
**FIPS 140-2 HSMs**: Use only FIPS 140-2 Level 3 (or higher) validated HSMs for root CA keys; verify HSM firmware signatures before use
**Split Knowledge**: Enforce strict split knowledge - no single person should ever possess complete key material or sufficient key components
**M-of-N Thresholds**: Implement M-of-N schemes (e.g., 3-of-5) for key backup; distribute components to trusted custodians in different locations
**Dual Control**: Require minimum 2 authorized persons present for all key operations; implement technical controls (two-person rule in HSM)
**Witness Requirements**: Require 2+ independent witnesses (internal audit, external auditor, legal counsel); document witness identities and roles
**Video Recording**: Record entire ceremony with multiple cameras; timestamp recording; retain per compliance requirements (typically 7+ years)
**Physical Security**: Conduct ceremonies in secure facility (data center, vault); implement access controls, tamper-evident seals, environmental monitoring
**Offline Environment**: Use air-gapped systems for root CA ceremonies; no network connectivity; verify media integrity before use
**Entropy Verification**: Verify HSM random number generator quality; test entropy sources; document RNG validation procedures
**Key Strength**: Use RSA 4096-bit or ECDSA P-384/P-521 for root CA keys; align with NIST SP 800-57 recommendations for multi-decade lifetimes
**Backup Redundancy**: Create multiple backup copies; store in geographically diverse secure facilities; use FIPS 140-2 Level 3 backup HSMs
**Component Distribution**: Distribute key components to custodians via registered mail or in-person delivery; require signed receipts
**Testing & Validation**: Immediately test generated keys (test signing, CSR generation); verify backup restore before concluding ceremony
**Documentation Completeness**: Document every step, deviation, participant, timestamp, equipment serial numbers, and environmental conditions
**Annual Drills**: Conduct annual recovery drills to verify backup procedures; test M-of-N key component assembly; validate disaster recovery processes
**Audit Trail Integrity**: Maintain tamper-evident audit logs; sign ceremony reports; store in append-only audit repository
