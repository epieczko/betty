# Name: discount-guardrails

## Executive Summary

The Discount Guardrails are formal policies that establish maximum allowable discounts, approval authority levels, and deal desk workflows to protect margins while enabling competitive deal-making. This critical revenue management framework defines discount approval matrices by deal size, customer segment, product tier, and approval authority (sales rep, manager, VP, CRO, CFO), ensuring pricing discipline while maintaining sales velocity.

As essential margin protection mechanisms, discount guardrails prevent excessive discounting that erodes profitability and sets unsustainable pricing precedents. They establish clear rules for standard discounts (10-15%), volume discounts (up to 25%), strategic deal discounts (25-35% with VP approval), and exception pricing (>35% requiring CFO/CRO approval). Integrated with CPQ systems and deal desk processes, guardrails automate approval routing, track discount trends, measure price realization rates, and identify margin leakage patterns.

### Strategic Importance

- **Margin Protection**: Prevents margin erosion by establishing clear discount limits aligned with profitability targets
- **Pricing Discipline**: Ensures consistent pricing approach across sales organization, preventing race-to-bottom discounting
- **Deal Velocity**: Streamlines approvals through clear authority levels, reducing deal cycle time for standard discounts
- **Price Realization**: Improves actual selling price vs list price realization rates through discount controls
- **Negotiation Framework**: Equips sales teams with clear boundaries for negotiations while enabling competitive deals
- **Revenue Quality**: Protects revenue quality and prevents deals that destroy long-term customer value perception
- **Strategic Flexibility**: Enables exception pricing for strategic deals while maintaining accountability through approvals

## Purpose & Scope

- **Maximum Discounts by Tier**: Absolute maximum discounts for each product/package tier to protect positioning
- **Deal Desk Workflows**: Approval routing, required justifications, competitive intelligence requirements
- **Volume Discount Framework**: Structured quantity-based discounts with pre-approved tiers
- **Multi-Year Discount Policy**: Guidelines for multi-year commitment discounts and payment terms
- **Competitive Displacement Pricing**: Rules for competitive takeaway deals with enhanced discounting

**Retention Compliance**: Follow organizational retention policies for how long to maintain and when to archive/destroy

**Discount Guardrails Best Practices**:
**Clear Authority Levels**: Define specific discount authority by role (rep 0-10%, manager 10-20%, director 20-30%, VP 30-40%, CRO/CFO >40%)
**Margin-Based Limits**: Set discount limits based on minimum acceptable gross margins, not arbitrary percentages
**CPQ Automation**: Automate approval routing in CPQ; prevent quotes from being sent without required approvals
**Fast-Track Standard Deals**: Auto-approve discounts within standard bands; require approval only for exceptions
**Deal Desk SLAs**: Establish 24-hour turnaround for standard approvals, 48-hour for VP-level approvals
**Required Justification**: Require competitive intelligence, business case, or strategic rationale for >20% discounts
**Volume Discount Tiers**: Pre-approve volume discounts at specific quantity breakpoints to streamline deals
**Multi-Year Incentives**: Offer structured multi-year discounts (5% for 2-year, 10% for 3-year) to improve cash flow
**Competitive Displacement**: Allow enhanced discounts (up to 35%) for competitive takeaways with VP approval
**Exception Documentation**: Require written justification and business case for all exception pricing (>35% discount)
**Discount Tracking**: Monitor discount rates by rep, manager, region; identify discount creep and outliers
**Price Realization Metrics**: Track average discount rate and price realization (actual vs list); target >75% realization
**Win Rate Analysis**: Analyze win rates by discount level; identify minimum effective discount for competitive wins
**Margin Floor Protection**: Establish absolute margin floor (e.g., 50% GM for SaaS); reject deals below floor
**Strategic Deal Process**: Create separate approval process for strategic/enterprise deals with board-level visibility
**Audit Trail**: Maintain complete audit trail of all approvals, justifications, and competitive intel
**Sales Training**: Train sales teams on discount policies, approval process, and negotiation strategies
**Quarterly Reviews**: Review discount trends quarterly; adjust guardrails based on competitive dynamics and margin targets
