# Name: helm-charts

## Executive Summary

The Helm Charts artifact defines Kubernetes application packaging and deployment specifications using Helm, the de facto package manager for Kubernetes that enables templated, versioned, and reproducible application deployments across multiple environments. This artifact establishes Chart.yaml metadata, values.yaml configuration hierarchies, templated Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps, Secrets), dependency management, and release lifecycle patterns to deploy complex microservices architectures, databases, monitoring stacks, and infrastructure components through declarative Helm chart packages compatible with Helm 3.x and OCI registry standards.

As the standard for Kubernetes application packaging and GitOps deployment workflows, this artifact serves Cloud Platform Engineers implementing platform services, DevOps Engineers automating multi-environment deployments, Site Reliability Engineers managing application releases, and Kubernetes Administrators maintaining cluster infrastructure. It addresses critical deployment patterns including blue-green deployments, canary releases, rollback strategies, environment-specific configuration overrides, secret management integration (Sealed Secrets, External Secrets Operator), and Helm hooks for pre/post-deployment tasks.

## Best Practices

**Version Control**: Store Helm charts in Git with semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH), increment chart version on every change
**Chart Structure**: Follow standard Helm chart layout (Chart.yaml, values.yaml, templates/, charts/, crds/, README.md)
**Semantic Versioning**: Use SemVer 2.0 for chart versions, track appVersion separately for application image versions
**values.yaml Design**: Provide sensible defaults in values.yaml, document all values with comments, group related values logically
**Template Functions**: Use Helm template functions (default, required, toYaml, include) for flexible, DRY chart design
**Resource Limits**: Always define resource requests and limits in values.yaml for all containers
**Health Checks**: Define livenessProbe and readinessProbe for all Deployments and StatefulSets
**Security Context**: Set securityContext with runAsNonRoot: true, readOnlyRootFilesystem: true, drop ALL capabilities
**RBAC Principle of Least Privilege**: Create minimal ServiceAccount permissions, never use cluster-admin
**Secret Management**: Never hardcode secrets in templates or values.yaml, use External Secrets Operator or Sealed Secrets
**Image Pinning**: Pin image tags to specific versions or digests in values.yaml, avoid :latest tag
**Ingress Annotations**: Use ingress annotations for SSL/TLS termination, certificate management (cert-manager)
**PodDisruptionBudget**: Define PDB for high-availability services to prevent disruption during upgrades
**Horizontal Pod Autoscaler**: Configure HPA for services with variable load to enable auto-scaling
**Environment Overrides**: Maintain separate values files (values-dev.yaml, values-staging.yaml, values-prod.yaml)
**Dependency Management**: Pin dependency chart versions in Chart.yaml, use helm dependency update
**Helm Hooks**: Use hooks for pre/post-install tasks (database migrations, smoke tests, cleanup jobs)
**Chart Testing**: Implement helm test with test pods to validate deployment success
**Linting**: Run `helm lint` and `helm template` validation before committing charts
**Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive README.md with installation instructions, configuration options, and troubleshooting
**OCI Registry**: Distribute charts via OCI-compliant registries (Harbor, ECR, ACR, GAR) for versioned artifact management
**Chart Signing**: Sign Helm charts with GPG for supply chain security verification
**GitOps Integration**: Design charts for ArgoCD/Flux deployment with clear application structure
**Rollback Strategy**: Test rollback procedures, ensure database migrations support backward compatibility
**Regular Updates**: Update chart dependencies and base images monthly for security patches
**Retention Compliance**: Follow organizational retention policies for how long to maintain and when to archive/destroy

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
