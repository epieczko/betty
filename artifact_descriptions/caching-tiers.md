# Name: caching-tiers

## Executive Summary

The Caching Tiers artifact documents multi-layer caching strategy across browser cache, CDN (CloudFront, Akamai, Cloudflare), application cache (Redis, Memcached), and database cache layers, defining cache hit ratio targets (>80%), TTL policies, invalidation strategies, and cache warming procedures. Effective caching reduces latency, decreases backend load, lowers infrastructure costs, and improves user experience by serving frequently accessed data from faster storage tiers.

Caching tiers transform system performance by avoiding expensive operations (database queries, API calls, computations) through strategic data placement at multiple levels. Browser caching eliminates network requests entirely, CDN caching serves static assets from geographically distributed edge locations, application caching (Redis/Memcached) provides sub-millisecond access to frequently used data, and database query caching reduces disk I/O. With appropriate TTL policies and cache hit ratios >80%, caching can reduce response times by 10-100x and infrastructure costs by 50%+.

### Strategic Importance

- **Latency Reduction**: Cache hits provide sub-millisecond to low-millisecond response times vs. 10-100ms+ for origin requests
- **Throughput Scaling**: Cache layers handle 10-100x more requests than origin servers at fraction of cost
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduces backend compute, database, and bandwidth costs by serving cached responses
- **Availability Improvement**: Cache layers provide resilience when origin servers are slow or unavailable
- **Global Performance**: CDN caching delivers content from edge locations close to users worldwide
- **Database Protection**: Application caching reduces database query load and connection pool pressure
- **User Experience**: Fast cache hits improve page load times, API response times, and Apdex scores

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact documents multi-tier caching architecture including browser cache, CDN layer, application cache (Redis/Memcached), and database cache, defining cache policies (TTL, eviction), hit ratio targets (>80%), invalidation strategies, monitoring metrics, and cache warming procedures to optimize performance and reduce infrastructure costs.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
