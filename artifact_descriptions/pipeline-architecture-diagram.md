# Name: pipeline-architecture-diagram

## Executive Summary

The Pipeline Architecture Diagram artifact is a visual documentation of data pipeline or CI/CD pipeline architecture, illustrating data flow, orchestration layers, processing components, storage systems, and serving layers. This artifact provides high-level and detailed architectural views using tools like Lucidchart, draw.io, Mermaid diagrams, or architecture-as-code platforms to communicate complex pipeline architectures to technical and business stakeholders.

As data platforms and DevOps systems grow in complexity with multiple orchestration tools (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster), data stores (data warehouses, data lakes, operational databases), processing engines (Spark, dbt, Flink), and integration points, this artifact serves Data Platform Architects designing end-to-end data architecture, DevOps Architects defining CI/CD infrastructure, Data Engineers understanding system integration points, and executive stakeholders evaluating technology investments and platform scalability.

### Strategic Importance

- **Architectural Communication**: Visualizes data pipeline architecture with orchestration (Airflow), ingestion (Fivetran), transformation (dbt), storage (Snowflake, S3), and serving layers (BI tools, APIs)
- **System Integration**: Documents integration points between source systems, ETL/ELT tools, data warehouses, data lakes, analytics platforms, and downstream consumers
- **Technology Stack**: Illustrates technology choices including cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), orchestration tools, data stores, processing engines, and observability tools
- **Data Flow**: Shows data movement from source systems through bronze/silver/gold layers to analytical consumption, including batch and streaming patterns
- **CI/CD Architecture**: Visualizes build pipelines, deployment workflows, artifact promotion, environment topology, and GitOps patterns
- **Scalability Design**: Communicates horizontal scaling, fault tolerance, high availability, disaster recovery, and performance optimization strategies
- **Decision Support**: Enables architecture review, technology selection, capacity planning, and roadmap discussions with visual clarity

**Diagrams as Code**: Use Mermaid, PlantUML, Python Diagrams, or Terraform Graph for version-controlled, maintainable diagrams
**Clear Data Flow**: Show direction of data movement with arrows, label data formats and volumes, indicate batch vs. streaming
**Technology Labeling**: Clearly identify all technologies used (Airflow 2.x, Snowflake, dbt 1.x, Kubernetes 1.28), include version information

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
