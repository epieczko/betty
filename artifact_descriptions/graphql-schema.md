# Name: graphql-schema

## Executive Summary

The GraphQL Schema is the foundational contract for GraphQL APIs, defining types, queries, mutations, subscriptions, and their relationships using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL). This strongly-typed schema enables client applications to precisely query for needed data, supports introspection and tooling, and provides a self-documenting API surface.

Built using GraphQL SDL (schema-first) or code-first approaches with frameworks like Apollo Server, GraphQL Yoga, Hasura, AWS AppSync, and Relay, GraphQL schemas leverage patterns including Apollo Federation for microservices, schema stitching, DataLoader for N+1 query optimization, cursor-based pagination, and persisted queries. They support features like custom scalars, directives, interfaces, unions, input types, and enable efficient data fetching across multiple backend services through a unified graph interface.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Best Practices

**Schema Design Principles**:
- **Nullable by Default**: Make fields nullable unless absolutely required; enables schema evolution
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, self-documenting field names (fullName not fn, createdAt not ct)
- **Consistent Naming**: Choose camelCase for fields/arguments; PascalCase for types/enums
- **Documentation**: Add descriptions to all types and fields using SDL doc strings (""")
- **Single Responsibility**: Each type should represent one concept; avoid "god objects"

**Type System Best Practices**:
- **Use Interfaces**: Extract common fields into interfaces for polymorphic queries
- **Union Types**: Use unions for fields that can return multiple types (search results)
- **Enums for Fixed Sets**: Use enums instead of strings for fixed value sets
- **Input Types**: Create dedicated input types for mutations; don't reuse output types
- **Custom Scalars**: Use custom scalars for domain-specific types (DateTime, Email, URL)

**Query Design**:
- **Granular Queries**: Provide specific queries instead of one generic query with many filters
- **Avoid Deep Nesting**: Limit query depth (typically 5-7 levels); prevents performance issues
- **Connection Pattern**: Use Relay Connection pattern for paginated lists
- **Filter Arguments**: Provide clear filtering, sorting, and pagination arguments

**Mutation Design**:
- **Single Purpose**: Each mutation should do one thing; avoid generic update mutations
- **Input Object Pattern**: Use input types for mutation arguments (CreateUserInput)
- **Return Payload**: Return payload object with mutation result, errors, and affected entity
- **Idempotency**: Design mutations to be idempotent when possible
- **Mutation Naming**: Use verb-noun pattern (createUser, updateOrder, deleteProduct)

**Subscription Design**:
- **Event-Based**: Model subscriptions as events (orderUpdated, not getOrder)
- **Filtered Subscriptions**: Allow filtering to reduce unnecessary updates
- **Payload Design**: Return full object or delta based on use case

**Nullability Strategy**:
- **Conservative Nullable**: Start with nullable fields; easier to make non-null later
- **Non-Null IDs**: Always make ID fields non-null
- **Required Arguments**: Make arguments non-null only if truly required
- **List Nullability**: Consider [Item!]! vs [Item]! vs [Item!] vs [Item] based on semantics

**Schema Evolution**:
- **Additive Changes**: Add new fields, types, arguments (non-breaking)
- **Deprecation**: Use @deprecated directive before removing fields
- **Breaking Changes**: Remove fields, change types, add required arguments (breaking)
- **Versioning**: Avoid versioning in field names; use schema evolution instead
- **Breaking Change Detection**: Use tools like GraphQL Inspector to detect breaking changes

**Federation Best Practices**:
- **Entity Design**: Use @key directive on entities; design stable keys
- **Boundary Definition**: Each service owns specific types; avoid overlap
- **Reference Resolution**: Use @provides to optimize cross-service queries
- **Type Extension**: Extend types across services thoughtfully; minimize coupling

**Performance Optimization**:
- **Query Complexity**: Implement query depth and complexity limits
- **Persisted Queries**: Use persisted queries for production; improve security and performance
- **DataLoader**: Prevent N+1 queries with DataLoader pattern in resolvers
- **Caching**: Use @cacheControl directive for field-level caching
- **Pagination**: Always paginate lists; use cursor-based for large datasets

**Error Handling**:
- **Partial Success**: Allow partial query success; return data and errors
- **Error Extensions**: Include error codes, details in extensions field
- **Union Result Types**: Use Result union types for expected errors
- **Field Errors**: Return field-level errors when possible

**Security Best Practices**:
- **Disable Introspection**: Disable in production to prevent schema discovery
- **Query Depth Limits**: Prevent deeply nested malicious queries
- **Complexity Analysis**: Calculate query cost; reject expensive queries
- **Authorization**: Implement field-level authorization in resolvers
- **Input Validation**: Validate all mutation inputs thoroughly

**Documentation**:
- **Schema Documentation**: Document every type, field, argument, enum value
- **Examples**: Provide query/mutation examples in documentation
- **Change Log**: Maintain schema change log with migration guides
- **Playground**: Provide GraphQL Playground/GraphiQL for exploration

**Testing**:
- **Schema Validation**: Validate schema syntax in CI/CD
- **Breaking Change Detection**: Automatically detect breaking schema changes
- **Contract Testing**: Test schema matches client expectations
- **Integration Tests**: Test actual queries against schema

**Version Control**:
- **Schema as Code**: Store .graphql schema files in version control
- **Schema Registry**: Use Apollo Studio or similar for schema management
- **Generated Types**: Commit or generate TypeScript/other types from schema
- **Linting**: Use graphql-schema-linter or ESLint plugin for consistency

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
