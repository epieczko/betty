# Name: artifact-store-policies

## Executive Summary

The Artifact Store Policies defines governance for centralized storage of build outputs, dependencies, and deployable packages across the software delivery lifecycle. This policy establishes rules for JFrog Artifactory Universal Repositories, Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager, and cloud-native artifact stores (AWS CodeArtifact, Google Artifact Registry, Azure Artifacts) that serve as the single source of truth for all binary artifacts, enabling reproducible builds, dependency management, and artifact lifecycle automation.

In high-performing DevOps organizations achieving 208x faster deployment frequency (per DORA research), artifact stores eliminate "works on my machine" problems by providing consistent, versioned dependencies across all environments. This policy reduces build times by 50-70% through intelligent caching, lowers supply chain security risks through vulnerability scanning and proxying of external dependencies, and ensures compliance through comprehensive audit trails. By implementing storage lifecycle rules (automatic cleanup of old versions, tiered storage for cold artifacts), organizations reduce infrastructure costs by 40% while maintaining audit requirements for 7-year retention of production artifacts.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact establishes mandatory policies for artifact storage infrastructure that supports reproducible builds, dependency management, and secure software supply chains. It defines repository types (release vs snapshot, public vs private), retention rules, caching strategies for external dependencies, and integration patterns with CI/CD pipelines. The policy ensures teams can reliably build and deploy software while maintaining security posture through vulnerability scanning, license compliance checking, and artifact provenance tracking across Maven, npm, Docker, Python, NuGet, and other package ecosystems.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Universal binary repositories (JFrog Artifactory Universal, Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager)
- Package-type-specific repositories (Maven, npm, Docker, PyPI, NuGet, Helm, Go modules, Conan)
- Cloud-native artifact storage (AWS CodeArtifact, Google Artifact Registry, Azure Artifacts, GitHub Packages)
- Repository types (local, remote/proxy, virtual, federated)
- External dependency proxying and caching (Maven Central, npm registry, Docker Hub)
- Artifact lifecycle management (retention, cleanup, archival, promotion)
- Build reproducibility (checksums, signatures, build metadata, SBOM integration)
- License compliance scanning (FOSSA, Black Duck, WhiteSource/Mend, Snyk)
- Vulnerability management (CVE scanning, auto-patching policies, security gates)
- Access control and permissions (RBAC, LDAP/AD integration, API tokens, service accounts)
- Storage optimization (deduplication, compression, storage tiering, quota management)
- Backup and disaster recovery (replication, backup schedules, RTO/RPO targets)

## Best Practices

**Repository Separation**: Separate release and snapshot repositories; releases are immutable, snapshots allow overwrites for development iterations
**Proxy External Dependencies**: Cache Maven Central, npm registry, PyPI in internal proxy repositories; reduces external dependency failures and improves build speed by 50-70%
**Checksum Verification**: Validate SHA-256 checksums for all downloaded artifacts; reject artifacts with mismatched checksums to prevent supply chain attacks
**Retention by Stability**: Keep release artifacts indefinitely or per compliance requirements (7 years); auto-delete snapshots after 30 days or keep last 10 versions
**License Compliance Scanning**: Scan all artifacts for license conflicts using FOSSA, Black Duck, or Snyk; block artifacts with non-approved licenses (GPL in commercial products)
**Virtual Repository Pattern**: Use virtual repositories (Artifactory) or repository groups (Nexus) to aggregate multiple repositories; provides single endpoint for clients
**Build Reproducibility**: Store artifact metadata (git commit, build timestamp, CI job ID, dependencies) to enable reproducible builds and incident investigation
**Vulnerability Auto-Remediation**: Automatically update dependency versions when CVEs are patched; test in dev, promote to prod after validation
**Storage Tiering**: Move artifacts older than 90 days to cheaper storage tiers (S3 Glacier, Azure Cool Blob); reduces storage costs by 40-60%
**Access Control by Repository**: Grant read access to release repositories broadly; restrict write access to CI/CD service accounts only
**Audit Trail Completeness**: Log all artifact operations (publish, download, delete) with user, timestamp, IP address; retain logs for 365+ days
**Backup and Replication**: Daily incremental backups with weekly full backups; replicate to secondary region for disaster recovery (RTO: 4 hours, RPO: 1 hour)
**Quota Management**: Set storage quotas per team or project; alert at 80% utilization, prevent new artifacts at 100% to control costs
**Dependency Update Policies**: Automatically update patch versions (1.2.3 to 1.2.4); require manual approval for minor/major version updates
**Artifact Promotion Workflow**: Promote artifacts from dev repository to staging to production; require quality gates (tests pass, security scans clear)
**Build Tool Integration**: Configure Maven settings.xml, npm .npmrc, pip pip.conf to use artifact store; provide templates and documentation
**Security Scanning on Upload**: Scan artifacts for vulnerabilities immediately on upload; quarantine high-severity findings until reviewed
**Deduplication**: Enable artifact deduplication (Artifactory filestore optimization); reduces storage by 30-50% for similar versions
**Metadata Enrichment**: Add custom properties to artifacts (team, project, environment, cost center); enables reporting and chargeback
**External Registry Mirroring**: Mirror critical external dependencies locally; ensures builds succeed even when external registries are down
**Garbage Collection**: Run weekly garbage collection to remove unreferenced artifacts; prevents storage bloat from deleted or overwritten artifacts
**Performance Monitoring**: Track artifact store response time (p95 < 200ms), throughput (downloads/sec), and availability (99.9% SLO)
**Disaster Recovery Drills**: Quarterly test artifact store restoration from backup; document procedures and validate RTO/RPO targets
**Cost Allocation Reporting**: Generate monthly reports of storage usage by team/project; implement chargeback to drive accountability for storage costs
