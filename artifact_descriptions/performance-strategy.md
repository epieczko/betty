# Name: performance-strategy

## Executive Summary

The Performance Strategy artifact defines comprehensive approach to application performance including performance budgets (P95 latency <200ms), Service Level Objectives (SLOs), monitoring strategy, testing cadence, optimization roadmap, and tooling decisions. This strategy ensures performance is treated as a first-class requirement throughout the development lifecycle, from design through production operation, with clear accountability and measurement frameworks.

Performance strategy establishes measurable targets (P95 API latency <200ms, P99 <500ms, Apdex >0.9), defines testing approach (load testing with JMeter/Gatling/k6, continuous performance regression testing in CI/CD), specifies monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic), and creates optimization roadmap prioritized by user impact. It transforms performance from reactive firefighting to proactive engineering discipline with clear SLOs, automated testing, and continuous measurement.

### Strategic Importance

- **Performance Culture**: Establishes performance as shared responsibility with clear targets and accountability
- **Proactive Optimization**: Shifts from reactive firefighting to planned optimization based on performance budgets
- **SLO-Driven Development**: Defines measurable Service Level Objectives for latency, throughput, and availability
- **Continuous Validation**: Integrates performance testing into CI/CD to catch regressions before production
- **User Experience Focus**: Aligns technical metrics with user experience through Apdex scores and percentile targets
- **Cost Efficiency**: Balances performance requirements with infrastructure costs through right-sizing and optimization
- **Competitive Advantage**: Fast, responsive applications improve conversion rates, user satisfaction, and retention

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
