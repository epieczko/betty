# Name: caching-strategy

## Executive Summary

The Caching Strategy artifact defines comprehensive multi-tier caching architecture for distributed systems, specifying cache technologies, invalidation patterns, TTL policies, and performance optimization strategies across browser, CDN, application, and database layers. This artifact establishes the blueprint for implementing high-performance caching solutions using Redis (Redis Cluster, Redis Sentinel), Memcached, Varnish Cache, browser caching directives, and CDN edge caching to dramatically reduce latency, minimize backend load, and enhance application scalability for millions of concurrent users.

As a foundational component of cloud-native performance engineering, this artifact serves Site Reliability Engineers optimizing application response times, Cloud Platform Engineers designing scalable infrastructure, DevOps Engineers implementing cache deployment pipelines, and Application Architects balancing consistency with performance. It addresses critical caching patterns including cache-aside, read-through, write-through, write-behind, and cache warming strategies while managing cache coherence, invalidation complexity, and the CAP theorem tradeoffs inherent in distributed caching systems.

## Best Practices

**Version Control**: Store in centralized version control system (Git, SharePoint with versioning, etc.) to maintain complete history and enable rollback
**Multi-Tier Caching Architecture**: Implement layered caching strategy (browser cache → CDN → application cache → database cache) to maximize performance
**Cache Key Design**: Use hierarchical, versioned cache keys with namespaces (e.g., `user:{userId}:profile:v2`, `product:{sku}:inventory`) for easy invalidation
**TTL Strategy**: Set appropriate TTLs based on data volatility (static content: 1 year, user sessions: 30 min, real-time data: 10-60 sec)
**Cache Invalidation**: Implement event-driven cache invalidation using message queues (Kafka, SQS, Redis Pub/Sub) rather than relying solely on TTL expiration
**Cache Stampede Prevention**: Use probabilistic early expiration, mutex locks, or stale-while-revalidate to prevent thundering herd when cache expires
**Redis Clustering**: Deploy Redis Cluster (3+ master nodes) or Redis Sentinel for high availability and automatic failover
**Memcached vs Redis**: Choose Memcached for simple key-value with LRU eviction, Redis for complex data structures, persistence, pub/sub, and Lua scripting
**Cache Warming**: Pre-populate cache during deployment with frequently accessed data before directing production traffic
**Monitor Hit Ratios**: Target 80-95% cache hit ratio; investigate cache misses, monitor eviction rates, and adjust memory allocation accordingly
**Sensitive Data Handling**: Never cache PII, PHI, or PCI data without encryption; implement short TTLs and immediate purge capabilities
**Connection Pooling**: Configure appropriate Redis/Memcached connection pools to prevent connection exhaustion (50-100 connections per app server)
**Data Serialization**: Use efficient serialization (MessagePack, Protocol Buffers) over JSON for faster serialization/deserialization in high-throughput scenarios
**Cache Aside Pattern**: Implement lazy loading with fallback to database; write-through for critical consistency requirements
**Distributed Locking**: Use Redis distributed locks (Redlock algorithm) to coordinate cache updates across multiple application instances
**Cache Monitoring**: Instrument cache operations with metrics (hit/miss ratio, latency p50/p95/p99, memory usage, eviction rate)
**Browser Caching**: Set appropriate Cache-Control headers (max-age, s-maxage, public/private, immutable for static assets)
**CDN Cache Behaviors**: Configure different TTLs per URL path pattern (static assets: long TTL, dynamic content: short TTL or no-cache)
**Peer Review**: Have at least one qualified SRE and application architect review caching strategy before implementation
**Regular Updates**: Review and update cache configuration quarterly or when traffic patterns change significantly
**Retention Compliance**: Follow organizational retention policies for how long to maintain and when to archive/destroy

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
