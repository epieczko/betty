# Name: auto-update-policies

## Executive Summary

The Auto Update Policies artifact defines governance rules for automated dependency, package, and system updates across infrastructure and application stacks. This policy establishes risk-based approval workflows, testing requirements, and rollback procedures for tools like Dependabot, Renovate Bot, AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, and Kubernetes operators.

In modern DevOps environments, managing thousands of dependencies manually is impossible. Automated updates reduce security exposure from CVEs, but uncontrolled automation can introduce breaking changes and service disruptions. This artifact balances velocity with safety by defining which updates can auto-merge, which require human review, and which must be gated by comprehensive testing.

### Strategic Importance

- **Security Posture**: Reduces mean time to patch (MTTP) for critical vulnerabilities from weeks to hours
- **Technical Debt Management**: Prevents dependency drift that makes major upgrades exponentially harder
- **Operational Efficiency**: Eliminates manual toil of reviewing thousands of minor version bumps
- **Risk Management**: Establishes safety rails preventing auto-merge of breaking changes
- **Compliance**: Supports SOC 2 CC7.1 (monitoring), PCI-DSS 6.2 (patching), and NIST 800-53 SI-2 (flaw remediation)

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

Defines automated update policies for dependencies, packages, OS patches, and infrastructure components, specifying which updates can auto-merge, which require human approval, and testing requirements for each category to balance security patching velocity with system stability.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Dependabot/Renovate Bot configuration for application dependencies (npm, pip, Maven, Go modules)
- OS patch management policies for EC2, containers, and VMs using AWS SSM, Ansible, or Chef
- Kubernetes cluster auto-upgrades (EKS, GKE, AKS control plane and node pools)
- Terraform provider and module version updates in IaC repositories
- Docker base image updates and vulnerability scanning thresholds (Trivy, Snyk, Aqua)
- Database minor version auto-patching windows for RDS, Aurora, Cloud SQL
- Security patch SLAs by severity (critical: 24h, high: 7d, medium: 30d, low: 90d)
- Auto-merge rules for patch versions (1.2.3 → 1.2.4) vs. manual review for minor (1.2.x → 1.3.0)
- Pre-merge testing requirements (unit, integration, smoke tests in staging)
- Rollback procedures and blue-green deployment strategies for failed updates
- Update notification channels (Slack, PagerDuty, email) and escalation paths
- Exemption process for pinned versions with technical justification

**Out of Scope**:
- Major version upgrades requiring migration planning (handled by change management)
- Application code changes (covered by code review policies)

## Best Practices

**Semantic Versioning Auto-Merge**: Auto-merge patch versions (1.2.3 → 1.2.4) for dependencies with passing tests; require manual review for minor (1.2.x → 1.3.0) and major (1.x.x → 2.0.0) updates to assess breaking changes
**Security CVE SLA Enforcement**: Critical vulnerabilities (CVSS 9.0+) patched within 24 hours; High (7.0-8.9) within 7 days; Medium (4.0-6.9) within 30 days; Low (<4.0) within 90 days with automated tracking in Jira/ServiceNow
**Dependabot Grouped PRs**: Configure Dependabot to group related dependencies (e.g., all React packages) into single PRs to reduce review burden and prevent version conflicts across related libraries
**Renovate Automerge Conditions**: Set Renovate to auto-merge only if CI passes, age of package >3 days (avoiding 0-day releases), and dependency has >80% adoption in npm/PyPI ecosystem
**Blue-Green Deployment for OS Patches**: Deploy patches to green fleet (new instances/containers) while keeping blue fleet running; cutover traffic after validation; rollback by reverting traffic to blue
**Kubernetes Node Pool Rolling Updates**: Use managed node pools (EKS/GKE/AKS) with max surge=1, max unavailable=0 to ensure zero-downtime upgrades; test in staging cluster first with identical addon versions
**Terraform Provider Version Pinning**: Pin provider versions to minor (e.g., ~> 4.0) in production modules to prevent breaking changes; use automated tests (terraform validate + plan) before auto-applying updates
**Container Base Image Layering**: Separate application layers from base OS layers; rebuild app containers nightly if base image has critical CVE; use multi-stage builds to minimize attack surface
**Database Maintenance Windows**: Schedule RDS/Aurora minor version upgrades during low-traffic windows (2-4 AM); enable automatic backups and test restore procedures before applying patches
**Dependency Pinning Exemptions**: Require written security waiver with business justification, compensating controls, and expiration date for any pinned dependency with known CVE; audit quarterly
**Rollback Automation**: Automate rollback if post-deployment smoke tests fail (health checks, API response times, error rates); retain previous 3 versions for quick revert
**Update Notification Hygiene**: Send high-signal notifications to #deployments Slack channel; suppress noise from auto-merged patch updates; escalate to PagerDuty only for failed critical security patches
**Testing Coverage Gates**: Require 80% unit test coverage, passing integration tests in staging, and synthetic monitoring checks before auto-merging any dependency updates
**Monorepo Update Coordination**: Use Renovate grouping to update all microservices in monorepo simultaneously; prevents version skew across services sharing common libraries
**Vulnerability Scanner Integration**: Block merges if Snyk/Trivy/Aqua detect high/critical CVEs in updated dependencies; auto-create Jira tickets for manual review of acceptable risk
**Change Advisory Board Bypass**: Pre-approved auto-merge for patch updates; minor updates reviewed asynchronously in CAB; major updates require formal RFC and CAB approval before scheduling
**Canary Deployments for Major Updates**: Deploy major version updates to 5% canary traffic for 2 hours monitoring error rates and latency before full rollout; auto-rollback if SLO violated
**Immutable Infrastructure for Patches**: Never patch running instances; always deploy patched AMI/container image; terminate old instances after validation to prevent configuration drift
**Compliance Audit Trail**: Log all auto-merged updates, manual approvals, and exemptions in immutable audit log (CloudTrail, Splunk, Datadog); retain for 7 years per SOC 2 requirements
**Developer Self-Service Overrides**: Allow developers to temporarily disable auto-merge for specific dependency during active refactoring; require security approval for >14 day extensions

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Overly Aggressive Auto-Merge**: Auto-merging minor/major versions without adequate testing causes production incidents
   ✓ *Solution*: Restrict auto-merge to patch versions only; require human review + staging validation for minor updates

❌ **Missing Rollback Procedures**: Automated updates deployed without rollback plan leave teams scrambling during incidents
   ✓ *Solution*: Document rollback commands for each update type; automate rollback on failed smoke tests

❌ **Notification Fatigue**: Sending alerts for every patch update trains teams to ignore critical security patch failures
   ✓ *Solution*: High-signal notifications only (failures, CVE patches, manual review needed); suppress successful auto-merges

❌ **Insufficient Test Coverage**: Auto-merging updates without comprehensive test suites causes undetected breaking changes
   ✓ *Solution*: Enforce 80% test coverage gate; require integration tests in staging before production deployment

❌ **Ignoring Dependency Conflicts**: Updating one package breaks transitive dependencies due to version incompatibilities
   ✓ *Solution*: Use Renovate grouping for related packages; run full test suite including integration tests before merge

❌ **No Security CVE Tracking**: Updates applied without knowing which CVEs are being patched limits audit trail
   ✓ *Solution*: Integrate vulnerability scanners (Snyk/Trivy) to link PRs to CVE identifiers and CVSS scores

❌ **Skipping Staging Validation**: Updates auto-merged directly to production without staging environment testing
   ✓ *Solution*: Mandatory staging deployment + smoke tests before production rollout; use GitOps promotion workflows

❌ **Database Downtime from Patches**: Applying database patches during peak traffic causes customer-impacting outages
   ✓ *Solution*: Schedule maintenance windows during low-traffic periods; use blue-green RDS deployments for zero downtime
