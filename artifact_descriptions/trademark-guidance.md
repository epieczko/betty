# Name: trademark-guidance

## Executive Summary

Trademark Guidance documents establish rules for using organization and third-party trademarks, logos, service marks, and brand assets in software, documentation, marketing, and community contexts. This guidance protects trademark rights under Lanham Act (15 USC 1051) while enabling nominative fair use, open-source attribution, and partner co-branding. Organizations must balance brand protection (preventing dilution, tarnishment, and generic use) with community enablement (allowing accurate product references, compatibility claims, and derivative works).

Modern trademark management addresses digital-era challenges: domain name disputes (UDRP/URS procedures), social media impersonation, app store trademark infringement, and open-source project naming conflicts. Companies like Linux Foundation, Apache Software Foundation, and Cloud Native Computing Foundation have established reference trademark policies governing logo usage, merchandise, and project naming that balance enforcement with ecosystem growth. Trademark guidance must address international considerations (Madrid Protocol for international registration), country-specific requirements (USPTO in US, EUIPO in EU), and trademark class classifications (Nice Classification for goods/services).

### Strategic Importance

- **Brand Protection**: Prevents trademark dilution, consumer confusion, and unauthorized commercial exploitation of brand equity
- **Legal Defensibility**: Establishes documentary evidence of trademark policing required to maintain trademark validity and prevent abandonment
- **Open Source Governance**: Enables community use of project trademarks while preventing fork confusion and competitive hijacking
- **Partner Enablement**: Provides clear co-branding, reseller, and integration partner guidelines reducing legal friction and approval delays
- **Domain/App Protection**: Combats cybersquatting, typosquatting, app store impersonation, and trademark keyword abuse
- **International Consistency**: Harmonizes trademark usage across jurisdictions with varying trademark laws and enforcement mechanisms
- **M&A Asset Valuation**: Well-documented trademark portfolio and usage guidelines increase brand asset valuation in acquisitions

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This guidance establishes permitted and prohibited uses of trademarks (word marks, logos, slogans, service marks) by internal teams, partners, community members, and third parties. It documents nominative fair use boundaries, logo usage specifications (minimum sizes, clear space, color requirements), attribution requirements, and enforcement procedures to maintain trademark distinctiveness while enabling ecosystem growth.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Trademark symbols: ® for registered marks, ™ for unregistered trademarks, ℠ for service marks, usage requirements
- Logo usage: minimum size, clear space, approved color variations (full color, monochrome, reverse), prohibited modifications
- Nominative fair use: accurate product references, compatibility statements, comparative advertising boundaries
- Attribution requirements: trademark acknowledgment language, first use bolding/capitalization, trademark notices in documentation
- Open-source project naming: project mark usage, fork naming restrictions, domain name guidelines
- Partner/reseller guidelines: co-branding approvals, integration badges, certified partner logos, marketing collateral review
- Merchandise/swag: branded apparel, stickers, promotional items requiring trademark license or approval
- Domain names: permissible domain registrations, typosquatting prevention, UDRP/URS dispute procedures
- App store guidelines: application naming, icon usage, subtitle/description trademark usage
- Social media: official account verification, parody/fan account distinctions, handle registration
- Enforcement: cease and desist procedures, trademark opposition, infringement reporting workflows

**Out of Scope**:
- Copyright licensing for software code (covered by open-source licenses)
- Patent licensing and defensive patent grants
- Trade secret protection and confidential information policies
- Domain name technical management (DNS, hosting) separate from trademark rights
- General brand style guides for marketing (typography, voice, tone) beyond trademark-specific rules

### Target Audience

**Primary Audience**:
- Legal Counsel: Trademark enforcement, UDRP filings, cease and desist letters, licensing agreement drafting
- Marketing/Brand Teams: Logo usage approvals, partner collateral review, brand compliance monitoring

- Partners/Resellers: Co-branding guidelines, certified partner logo usage, joint marketing approvals
- Community Members: Merchandise creation, fan sites, meetup group branding, user group logos

## Best Practices

**Public Trademark Guidelines Page**: Publish trademark policy at domain.com/trademark or /legal/trademark-policy for easy reference and linking
**Registered Mark Documentation**: Maintain registry of ® marks with USPTO registration numbers, registration dates, and renewal schedules
**First Use Symbol Requirements**: Require ® or ™ on first prominent use in documents, presentations, and web pages (can omit in subsequent uses)
**Logo Asset Portal**: Provide downloadable logo packages (ZIP with SVG, PNG, EPS formats) with usage guidelines PDF in brand portal
**Nominative Use Examples**: Include acceptable examples: "integrates with [Trademark]", "compatible with [Product]", "migration from [Product]"
**Prohibited Use Examples**: Document unacceptable uses: altered logos, misleading sponsorship claims, generic trademark use (e.g., "kubernetes" as common noun)
**Partner Co-Branding Approval**: Establish review process with 5-10 business day SLA for partner logo usage in marketing materials
**Domain Monitoring**: Use trademark watch services (MarkMonitor, Corsearch) to detect domain registrations containing brand terms
**App Store Monitoring**: Regularly search Apple App Store and Google Play for apps using trademarks in names/icons without authorization
**Social Media Verification**: Secure verified accounts (blue checkmark) on major platforms to prevent impersonation
**Open Source Fork Naming**: Require fork projects to use differentiated names (e.g., "MySQL" vs "MariaDB" differentiation model)
**Generic Use Prevention**: Train marketing teams to avoid generic trademark use (e.g., "google it" → "search for it") to prevent genericide
**Attribution Template**: Provide standard trademark acknowledgment: "[Trademark]® is a registered trademark of [Company] in the U.S. and other countries"
**Merchandise Licensing**: Implement trademark license for community-created merchandise with royalty-free terms for non-commercial swag
**UDRP Ready Documentation**: Maintain evidence of trademark use in commerce, policing efforts, and bad-faith cybersquatting patterns for UDRP filings
**Clear Space Enforcement**: Specify minimum clear space around logos (typically equal to logo height) in all brand guidelines
**Color Specifications**: Document primary colors with Pantone, HEX, RGB, CMYK values for consistent reproduction across media
**Scalability Testing**: Ensure logos remain legible at minimum size (typically 72px digital, 0.25 inches print)
**Modification Prohibition**: Explicitly prohibit logo rotation, stretching, recoloring, adding effects, or combining with other graphics
**Enforcement Escalation**: Define tiered response: friendly reminder → cease and desist → UDRP/legal action based on violation severity
