# Name: hyperparameter-configurations

## Executive Summary

The Hyperparameter Configurations artifact documents the hyperparameter search space, optimization methodology, tuning results, and final parameter selections for ML models. This artifact enables reproducible model training, tracks hyperparameter tuning experiments, and provides evidence of systematic optimization for model performance and fairness objectives.

This artifact leverages hyperparameter optimization frameworks including Optuna, Ray Tune, Hyperopt, and scikit-learn GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV. It documents search strategies (grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms), optimization objectives (accuracy, F1, AUC-ROC, fairness-constrained optimization), and computational resources consumed during tuning experiments.

The configuration enables ML Engineers and Data Scientists to reproduce model training, understand hyperparameter sensitivity, compare tuning runs, and justify parameter selections. It integrates with MLflow Tracking for experiment logging, Weights & Biases for visualization, and model registries for linking hyperparameters to deployed model versions.

## Best Practices

**Bayesian Over Random**: Prefer Bayesian optimization (Optuna, Ray Tune with TPE) over random search for sample-efficient tuning
**Log Everything**: Log all hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts to MLflow or W&B; enable experiment comparison
**Fixed Random Seeds**: Always set random seeds for NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn for reproducibility
**Search Space Design**: Use log-uniform distributions for learning rates, exponential distributions for batch sizes
**Sufficient Budget**: Allocate sufficient trials (50-100+ for Bayesian, 1000+ for random search) before declaring convergence
**Cross-Validation**: Use stratified K-fold (k=5 or 10) for hyperparameter tuning; avoid holdout validation
**Early Stopping**: Implement early stopping (ASHA, Hyperband) to prune poor configurations and save compute
**Warm Start**: Initialize Bayesian optimization with grid search or expert knowledge as priors
**Parallel Tuning**: Leverage distributed tuning (Ray Tune, SageMaker) to reduce wall-clock time
**Multi-Objective Optimization**: For production models, optimize for multiple objectives (accuracy + latency, performance + fairness)
**Sensitivity Analysis**: Use ANOVA or Sobol indices to identify most important hyperparameters
**Nested CV**: Use nested cross-validation for unbiased performance estimates when tuning hyperparameters
**Resource Tracking**: Log GPU hours, CPU hours, and cost for hyperparameter tuning; optimize ROI
**Transfer Learning**: Reuse successful hyperparameter configurations from similar problems as starting points
**Fairness Integration**: Incorporate fairness constraints using Fairlearn's GridSearch or ThresholdOptimizer
**Avoid Overfitting**: Monitor train-validation gap; tune regularization parameters (L2, dropout, weight_decay)
**Version Hyperparameters**: Store hyperparameters in version control (YAML/JSON config files)
**Link to Model Registry**: Record MLflow run_id or W&B run_id in model registry for full traceability
**Document Rationale**: Explain hyperparameter choices, search space design decisions, and optimization objectives
**Automate Pipelines**: Integrate hyperparameter tuning into CI/CD pipelines for continuous model improvement

   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
