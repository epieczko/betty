# Name: genai-safety-evaluations

## Executive Summary

The GenAI Safety Evaluations assess large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems for safety vulnerabilities including prompt injection, jailbreaking, hallucinations, toxic content generation, data leakage, and adversarial attacks. These evaluations align with OWASP LLM Top 10, NIST AI RMF trustworthy characteristics, and emerging GenAI security frameworks to identify risks specific to foundation models.

This evaluation documents red teaming exercises, adversarial testing results, hallucination rate measurement, toxicity scoring (Perspective API), prompt injection detection, PII leakage testing, and content filtering effectiveness. It assesses guardrails (input validation, output filtering), RAG security (retrieval poisoning, context injection), agent safety (tool misuse, unintended actions), and model alignment (RLHF effectiveness, value alignment).

The evaluation supports ML Engineers in implementing safety controls, AI Governance Teams in risk assessment for LLM deployments, Security Teams in threat modeling, and Product Teams in understanding safety limitations. It informs deployment decisions, user warnings, content moderation policies, and incident response playbooks for GenAI-specific risks.

## Best Practices

**Red Team Before Deployment**: Conduct structured red teaming with adversarial mindset before production deployment
**OWASP LLM Top 10 Coverage**: Test for all OWASP LLM Top 10 vulnerabilities systematically
**Automated Safety Testing**: Integrate safety tests (hallucination, toxicity, injection) into CI/CD pipelines
**Diverse Attack Vectors**: Test multiple jailbreaking techniques (DAN, persona, encoding, multi-turn manipulation)
**Quantitative Metrics**: Measure hallucination rate, toxicity scores, injection success rate, not just qualitative assessment
**Benchmark Baselines**: Evaluate on standard benchmarks (TruthfulQA, RealToxicityPrompts, BBQ) for comparability
**Production Monitoring**: Deploy runtime safety monitoring (Guardrails AI, NeMo Guardrails, LLM Guard)
**Layered Defenses**: Implement defense-in-depth (input validation, prompt engineering, output filtering, content moderation)
**RAG Security**: Test retrieval poisoning, context injection; validate document sources
**Agent Sandboxing**: Restrict agent tool access, implement human-in-loop for high-risk actions
**PII Detection**: Use automated PII detection (Microsoft Presidio, AWS Comprehend) on inputs and outputs
**Hallucination Mitigation**: Implement citation requirements, confidence scoring, factuality checking
**User Warnings**: Provide clear disclaimers about limitations, hallucination risks, accuracy caveats
**Incident Response**: Define playbooks for safety incidents (viral jailbreak, toxic output, PII leak)
**Continuous Evaluation**: Re-run safety evaluations after model updates, fine-tuning, or prompt changes
**Adversarial Suffixes**: Test robustness to adversarial suffixes (GCG attacks, universal adversarial prompts)
**Multi-Turn Attacks**: Test multi-turn jailbreaking strategies that build context gradually
**System Prompt Protection**: Use instruction hierarchy, delimiter-based separation to protect system prompts
**Output Validation**: Implement structured output validation, schema enforcement, content policies
**Third-Party Model Risk**: Apply same safety rigor to API-based models (GPT-4, Claude, PaLM) as internal models
