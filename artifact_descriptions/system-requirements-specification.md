# Name: system-requirements-specification

## Executive Summary

The System Requirements Specification (SyRS) defines comprehensive system-level requirements including capabilities, interfaces, constraints, performance characteristics, and operational parameters across hardware, software, and integration components. Following IEEE 29148 and ISO/IEC 15288 standards for systems engineering, this artifact establishes the complete technical foundation for system design, development, integration, and validation activities.

This authoritative specification documents functional and non-functional requirements at the system level, external interfaces (APIs, protocols, data exchanges), system constraints (technical, regulatory, environmental), quality attributes per ISO 25010, and compliance requirements. Managed in enterprise tools like IBM DOORS Next, Jama Connect, Polarion, or Azure DevOps, the SyRS serves as the contract between stakeholders and engineering teams, ensuring system architecture, design, and implementation satisfy all specified system requirements.

## Best Practices

**System-Level Thinking**: Define requirements at appropriate system level; avoid premature design decisions or implementation details
**Interface Specification**: Use interface control documents (ICDs) to precisely define system boundaries and external interfaces
**Constraints Documentation**: Explicitly document all technical, regulatory, environmental, and operational constraints
**NFR Quantification**: Specify measurable non-functional requirements (e.g., "95% availability" not "highly available")
**System Context Diagram**: Include system context diagram showing system boundary and external entities/systems
**Requirements Allocation**: Trace system requirements to subsystems and components through allocation matrices
**Interface Standards**: Specify interface protocols, data formats, APIs using industry standards (REST, SOAP, gRPC, MQTT)
**Regulatory Mapping**: Map regulatory requirements (FDA 21 CFR Part 11, ISO 13485, IEC 62304) to system requirements
**SysML Modeling**: Use SysML for complex systems engineering requirements modeling and analysis
**Requirements Management Tools**: Use enterprise tools (DOORS Next, Jama, Polarion) for requirements lifecycle management
**Verification Methods**: Specify verification method for each requirement (test, analysis, inspection, demonstration)
**System Modes**: Define system operational modes, state transitions, startup, shutdown, and failure behaviors
**Performance Budgets**: Allocate performance budgets (latency, throughput, memory) across system components
**Security by Design**: Integrate security requirements (STRIDE threat model, security controls) at system level
**Failure Mode Analysis**: Document failure scenarios, error handling, fault tolerance, and recovery requirements
**Bidirectional Traceability**: Maintain traceability to business requirements and forward to design and tests
**System Validation**: Define system-level validation criteria and acceptance tests
**Configuration Management**: Use configuration baselines and formal change control for system requirements
**Stakeholder Reviews**: Conduct System Requirements Review (SRR) with all stakeholders before design phase

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
