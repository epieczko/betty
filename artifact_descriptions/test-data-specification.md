# Name: test-data-specification

## Executive Summary

The Test Data Specification artifact defines data requirements, sources, generation strategies, and management approaches for test environments across unit, integration, system, performance, and UAT testing. It specifies synthetic data generation (Faker, Mockaroo), production data masking/anonymization (GDPR/CCPA compliance), test data subsetting, referential integrity maintenance, and refresh cycles ensuring production-like datasets without exposing sensitive information.

As the foundational test data management deliverable, this artifact serves QA engineers, test automation engineers, database administrators, DevOps engineers, and compliance officers who need reliable, compliant test data. Specifications cover data volume requirements (performance testing datasets sized appropriately for load), data variety (positive/negative/boundary test cases), data generation tools (Faker.js, Python Faker, SQL generators), data masking techniques (tokenization, encryption, substitution, shuffling), test data refresh frequency, environment-specific data requirements, and GDPR/CCPA/HIPAA compliance for personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI). Target metrics include data freshness (within 30 days of production), coverage (representing all production data scenarios), and compliance (zero production PII in non-production environments).

### Strategic Importance

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
