# Name: uat-sign-off-document

## Executive Summary

The UAT Sign-Off Document is a formal acceptance artifact that validates software releases meet business requirements, functional specifications, and acceptance criteria before production deployment. This document provides evidence that User Acceptance Testing has been completed according to IEEE 29119-3 standards, test cases have been executed with documented results, and business stakeholders have verified the system performs as expected in realistic scenarios with production-like data.

The sign-off captures formal approval from Product Owners, Business Analysts, QA Managers, and executive sponsors, establishing a go/no-go decision point for release. It includes test execution summaries, defect disposition (accepted, deferred, or blocked), traceability matrices linking requirements to test cases, and risk assessments for any known issues proceeding to production. This artifact satisfies SOC 2 change management controls, supports compliance audits, and provides legal protection by documenting that business stakeholders explicitly accepted system capabilities and limitations before launch.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Best Practices

**Acceptance Criteria Upfront**: Define measurable acceptance criteria during requirements gathering, not during UAT execution
**Representative Test Data**: Use production-like data volumes and realistic scenarios that reflect actual business operations
**Business User Involvement**: Ensure actual end users (not just BAs or proxy testers) participate in UAT execution
**Traceability Matrix**: Maintain complete RTM linking every requirement to test cases and execution results
**Evidence Collection**: Capture screenshots, screen recordings, and log exports for critical test scenarios as proof of execution
**Defect Triage Discipline**: Classify every defect by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) with clear disposition decisions
**No Surprises**: Conduct daily standups during UAT to surface issues early and avoid last-minute sign-off blockers
**Conditional Approval**: Allow sign-off with documented acceptance of minor defects to be fixed post-production
**Sign-Off Authority**: Clearly identify who has approval authority; require signatures from Product Owner and Business Sponsor
**Risk Assessment**: Document risks of proceeding with known defects, including business impact and mitigation plans
**Exit Criteria Compliance**: Verify all pre-defined exit criteria are met before requesting sign-off
**Version Identification**: Clearly document which build/version was tested to prevent confusion with later releases
**Regression Testing**: Include regression tests for previously delivered functionality to detect unintended side effects
**Performance Baselines**: Establish performance benchmarks and verify UAT environment meets acceptance thresholds
**Security Validation**: Include security test results from SAST/DAST scans and penetration testing in sign-off package
**Accessibility Compliance**: Test with assistive technologies and verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for public-facing applications
**Training Completion**: Verify end-user training materials are complete and training sessions conducted before sign-off
**Rollback Testing**: Validate rollback procedures work correctly in case production deployment fails
**Go-Live Checklist**: Include operational readiness checklist (monitoring, runbooks, support team readiness) in sign-off
**Audit Trail Preservation**: Retain complete test execution records, defect logs, and sign-off documents per compliance requirements

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
