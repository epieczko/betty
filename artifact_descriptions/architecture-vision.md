# Name: architecture-vision

## Executive Summary

The Architecture Vision defines the target state architecture and transformation roadmap for evolving from current state to desired future state, aligning with TOGAF 9.2 ADM Phase A (Architecture Vision). This strategic artifact articulates the long-term architectural direction, technology evolution path, capability model development, and migration strategy using proven patterns like the Strangler Fig pattern for legacy modernization.

The vision incorporates a Technology Radar (ThoughtWorks model with adopt/trial/assess/hold quadrants) to communicate technology direction, a capability heat map showing maturity levels across business capabilities, and a multi-phase migration roadmap with defined milestones. It addresses target state quality attributes (ISO 25010), cloud adoption strategy (AWS/Azure/GCP Well-Architected alignment), microservices evolution, data architecture transformation, and security architecture maturity progression toward Zero Trust. The artifact provides executive-level strategic context while maintaining technical depth for architecture teams to execute the transformation.

## Best Practices

**Business Alignment**: Ground vision in business strategy and objectives; map technical capabilities to business capabilities; demonstrate ROI and business value of transformation
**Stakeholder Engagement**: Conduct architecture workshops with business, product, and technology leaders; build consensus on priorities; address concerns and constraints early
**Current State Honesty**: Conduct thorough current state assessment including technical debt, security vulnerabilities, scalability limitations; avoid sugar-coating challenges
**Measurable Targets**: Define specific, measurable quality attribute targets using ISO 25010 and SEI scenarios; avoid vague aspirations like "improve performance"
**Phased Approach**: Break transformation into manageable phases (typically 3-5 phases over 2-4 years); define clear milestones and success criteria for each phase
**Technology Radar**: Maintain living Technology Radar with quarterly updates; classify technologies as adopt (standard), trial (pilot), assess (investigate), hold (avoid)
**Strangler Fig Planning**: For legacy modernization, identify high-value functionality to migrate first; maintain parallel operation; define decommissioning triggers
**Capability Heat Maps**: Create visual capability maturity assessments with color coding (red=lacking, yellow=developing, green=mature); prioritize red/yellow capabilities
**Reference Architectures**: Develop target state reference architectures for common patterns (web apps, APIs, batch processing, real-time analytics); provide reusable blueprints
**Cloud Strategy Clarity**: Define explicit cloud adoption approach (cloud-first, cloud-native, hybrid, multi-cloud); align with AWS/Azure/GCP Well-Architected Framework
**Security Evolution**: Map Zero Trust maturity progression; define identity-centric security approach; eliminate implicit trust zones over time
**Data Strategy**: Articulate data architecture vision (centralized warehouse, decentralized mesh, lakehouse); address master data management and data governance
**Integration Patterns**: Define target integration patterns (synchronous APIs, asynchronous events, batch); rationalize or eliminate legacy ESB if applicable
**API Strategy**: Adopt API-first approach; standardize on REST/GraphQL; implement API gateway for cross-cutting concerns; version APIs from inception
**Observability Vision**: Define target state for monitoring, logging, tracing, and alerting; adopt OpenTelemetry standards; implement SLO-based alerting
**Investment Sequencing**: Use value stream mapping to identify highest-value transformation areas; sequence initiatives based on WSJF (value/effort/risk)
**Dependency Management**: Create dependency maps showing which initiatives enable others; identify critical path; plan for parallel workstreams
**Risk Mitigation**: Document transformation risks (technology, organizational, integration, security); define mitigation strategies; plan for contingencies
**Skills Assessment**: Evaluate team skills against target state requirements; plan training, hiring, or partnering to close gaps
**Iterative Refinement**: Treat vision as living document; update quarterly based on lessons learned, technology evolution, business changes
**Visual Communication**: Use ArchiMate for enterprise views, C4 Model for system views, capability heat maps, roadmap timelines; make vision scannable and understandable
**Executive Summary**: Provide 1-page executive summary highlighting business value, investment required, timeline, and key risks; enable executive decision-making
**Governance Alignment**: Ensure vision aligns with architecture principles and governance framework; socialize with ARB for endorsement
**Communication Plan**: Present vision in town halls, architecture forums, engineering all-hands; create FAQ, demos, and reference implementations to build buy-in

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
