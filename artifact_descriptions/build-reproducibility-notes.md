# Name: build-reproducibility-notes

## Executive Summary

Build Reproducibility Notes document the technical specifications, environmental constraints, and verification procedures required to achieve deterministic, bit-for-bit reproducible software builds. These notes are critical for supply chain security, build provenance verification, and compliance with SLSA Framework requirements.

Reproducible builds ensure that building the same source code with the same build tools produces byte-identical artifacts, regardless of when or where the build occurs. This capability is foundational for verifying software integrity, detecting supply chain attacks, establishing trusted build provenance, and enabling independent verification of released binaries against published source code.

### Strategic Importance

- **Supply Chain Security**: Enables verification that distributed binaries match claimed source code without tampering
- **Build Provenance**: Provides cryptographic proof of build inputs, environment, and process for audit trails
- **SLSA Compliance**: Supports SLSA Framework levels 2-4 requirements for build integrity and reproducibility
- **Independent Verification**: Allows third parties to verify binaries by reproducing builds from source
- **Attack Detection**: Makes supply chain compromises detectable through build artifact comparison
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets NIST SP 800-218, EO 14028, and software supply chain security requirements
- **Hermetic Builds**: Isolates builds from environmental variations and non-deterministic inputs

## Best Practices

**SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH**: Set SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH environment variable to git commit timestamp for reproducible timestamps
**Pin All Dependencies**: Lock every dependency to exact versions with cryptographic checksums in lock files
**Hermetic Builds**: Isolate builds from system state; disable network access during build execution
**Fixed Tool Versions**: Pin exact versions of all build tools, compilers, and SDKs (no "latest" tags)
**Deterministic Compression**: Use deterministic tar/zip options (--sort=name, --mtime, --clamp-mtime)
**Normalize File Order**: Sort files alphabetically before archiving to ensure consistent ordering
**Remove Build IDs**: Strip or normalize build IDs, UUIDs, and random identifiers from artifacts
**Timezone Normalization**: Set TZ=UTC to ensure timezone-independent builds
**Locale Consistency**: Set LC_ALL=C to prevent locale-dependent sorting or formatting variations
**Container Base Images**: Use digest-pinned base images (sha256:...) not tags in Dockerfiles
**Reproducibility Testing**: Run builds multiple times on different machines to verify reproducibility
**Build Provenance**: Generate SLSA provenance attestations for all builds with build metadata
**Cryptographic Verification**: Publish SHA-256 checksums alongside all released artifacts
**Build Environment Documentation**: Document exact OS, kernel version, and all installed packages
**Dependency Mirrors**: Use stable, trusted artifact repository mirrors with checksum verification
**Disable Timestamps**: Configure build tools to exclude or normalize embedded timestamps
**Consistent File Permissions**: Normalize file permissions and ownership in archives
**Eliminate Randomness**: Replace random values (UUIDs, salt) with deterministic alternatives from source
**Independent Rebuilds**: Enable third-party verification by publishing complete build instructions
**Continuous Verification**: Automate reproducibility checks in CI/CD for every build

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
