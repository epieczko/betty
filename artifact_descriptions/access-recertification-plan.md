# Name: access-recertification-plan

## Executive Summary

The Access Recertification Plan establishes a comprehensive, risk-based approach for periodic validation of user access rights across enterprise systems, applications, and data repositories. This operational plan implements Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) best practices aligned with NIST SP 800-53 AC-2 (Account Management), ISO 27001 A.9.2.5 (Review of User Access Rights), SOC 2 CC6.1-CC6.3 (Logical Access Controls), and SOX ITGC requirements for segregation of duties (SOD) and least privilege enforcement.

Modern access recertification leverages IGA platforms such as SailPoint IdentityIQ, Saviynt, Okta Identity Governance, Microsoft Entra Identity Governance, or One Identity Manager to automate quarterly or bi-annual access reviews, detect orphaned accounts, identify excessive permissions, and validate role assignments. The plan establishes systematic review cycles (typically 90-day intervals for high-risk systems, 180-day for standard systems), defines role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) certification workflows, integrates with Joiner-Mover-Leaver (JML) processes, and implements automated remediation for identified violations.

Risk-based prioritization focuses certification efforts on privileged accounts (admin, root, domain admin), sensitive systems (financial, HR, production databases), SOD conflict resolution, dormant account deactivation, contractor/vendor access validation, and regulatory compliance requirements (PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR Article 32). Certification campaigns leverage role mining analytics, peer group comparisons, access anomaly detection, and business owner attestations to ensure access aligns with current job responsibilities and principle of least privilege.

### Strategic Importance

- **Compliance Assurance**: Satisfies audit requirements for SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, PCI DSS 7.1/8.1, HIPAA 164.308(a)(4), SOX ITGC, GDPR Article 32, and regulatory examinations
- **Excessive Access Remediation**: Identifies and removes unnecessary privileges accumulated through role changes, project assignments, and permission creep (typically 20-40% reduction in first campaign)
- **Orphaned Account Detection**: Discovers and disables accounts for terminated employees, inactive contractors, forgotten service accounts, and zombie accounts lacking recent authentication
- **SOD Violation Resolution**: Detects and remediates toxic combinations of permissions that violate segregation of duties policies (e.g., create vendor + approve payment, developer + production deploy)
- **Insider Threat Mitigation**: Reduces attack surface by removing unnecessary access that could be exploited by malicious insiders or compromised credentials
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automates previously manual, spreadsheet-based access reviews; reduces manager workload through role-based certification and delegation workflows

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This plan defines the end-to-end access recertification program including campaign scheduling, scope definition, review workflows, remediation procedures, metrics/reporting, and continuous improvement mechanisms. It establishes accountability for access governance, documents technical implementation using IGA platforms, and provides operational runbooks for quarterly/annual certification campaigns.

**Risk-Based Prioritization**: Prioritize high-risk systems (privileged access, financial, PII/PHI) for quarterly reviews; standard systems for bi-annual reviews
**Campaign Sizing**: Limit campaign scope to 500-1000 accounts per reviewer; larger campaigns reduce completion rates and increase fatigue
**Delegation Workflows**: Allow managers to delegate reviews to trusted lieutenants; maintain accountability through approval chains
**Role-Based Optimization**: Certify by business role rather than individual entitlements where appropriate; reduces review volume by 60-80%
**Pre-Campaign Data Quality**: Cleanse orphaned accounts, update job titles, validate reporting structures before launching campaigns to reduce noise
**Automated Recommendations**: Leverage IGA analytics to suggest certifications based on peer group analysis and historical patterns
**Grace Period Management**: Provide 7-14 day grace periods for critical access before auto-revocation to prevent business disruption
**SOD Continuous Monitoring**: Implement real-time SOD conflict detection during provisioning rather than quarterly remediation
**Certification Evidence Retention**: Retain certification decisions and justifications for minimum 7 years for audit and regulatory requirements
**Manager Training**: Provide certification training to managers including how to interpret entitlements, escalation procedures, and compliance obligations
**Non-Response Escalation**: Escalate to skip-level managers and CISO for campaigns >30 days overdue; consider disciplinary action for persistent non-compliance
**Remediation SLAs**: Define time-to-revoke SLAs (e.g., 7 days for denied access, 48 hours for privileged access, 24 hours for SOD violations)
**False Positive Tuning**: Track and reduce false positive SOD rules through business validation; document compensating controls for unavoidable conflicts
**Certification Metrics Dashboard**: Publish real-time completion rates, revocation statistics, and SOD violations to drive accountability and transparency
**Integration with Termination Process**: Auto-trigger immediate recertification for team when employee terminates to identify knowledge transfer gaps
**Service Account Governance**: Establish service account owners for certification; document purpose and rotate credentials during review process
**Cloud Entitlement Management**: Extend certification to cloud IAM roles, resource-based policies, and excessive cloud permissions (CSPM integration)
