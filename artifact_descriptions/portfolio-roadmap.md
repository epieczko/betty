# Name: portfolio-roadmap

## Executive Summary

The Portfolio Roadmap is a strategic planning artifact that visualizes the product development timeline, strategic themes, major initiatives, and delivery milestones across the product portfolio. This artifact translates product strategy into a sequenced execution plan using industry-standard roadmapping approaches including Now/Next/Later frameworks, theme-based roadmaps, and outcome-driven planning.

Built using tools like Aha!, ProductPlan, Roadmunk, Jira Product Discovery, or ProductBoard, this roadmap communicates what's being built, why it matters, when it's targeted, and what dependencies exist. It serves Product Managers, Engineering Leadership, Executive teams, and cross-functional stakeholders who need visibility into product direction, resource allocation, and strategic priorities. The roadmap balances strategic vision with tactical execution, using confidence levels (committed, likely, exploring) to manage stakeholder expectations while maintaining strategic flexibility.

### Strategic Importance

- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
