# Name: notarization-records

## Executive Summary

The Notarization Records artifact documents platform-specific software verification and malware scanning processes required for distribution on Apple platforms (macOS Gatekeeper, iOS), Windows (SmartScreen), and other ecosystems. This artifact captures notarization submission workflows, automated security analysis results, malware detection outcomes, and distribution approval decisions essential for user trust and platform compliance.

As a critical security control for software distribution, notarization records serve release teams submitting applications for platform verification, security teams monitoring malware detection trends, and compliance teams demonstrating adherence to platform security requirements. Integration with Apple Notary Service (notarytool, Xcode), Windows App Certification Kit, and automated scanning services (VirusTotal, automated malware analysis) provides comprehensive documentation of security validation before software reaches end users.

## Best Practices

**Sign Before Notarizing**: Always code sign with valid Developer ID certificate before submitting to Apple Notary Service; unsigned apps will be rejected
**Hardened Runtime**: Enable hardened runtime for macOS apps (--options runtime); required for notarization; configure necessary entitlements
**Timestamp Signatures**: Include secure timestamp (--timestamp flag); enables signature verification after certificate expiration
**Automated Notarization**: Integrate notarization into CI/CD (notarytool in Xcode Cloud, GitHub Actions, Jenkins); avoid manual submission workflows
**Staple Tickets**: Staple notarization tickets to distributed apps (stapler staple); enables offline Gatekeeper verification without internet
**VirusTotal Scanning**: Scan releases with VirusTotal before distribution; proactively identify false positives; contact AV vendors for whitelisting
**False Positive Procedures**: Document AV vendor submission processes; maintain contact list; track false positive resolution timelines
**SmartScreen Reputation**: For Windows, use EV Code Signing to accelerate SmartScreen reputation; monitor telemetry for SmartScreen blocks
**Entitlements Minimization**: Request minimum necessary entitlements; broad entitlements (e.g., disable-library-validation) increase security review scrutiny
**Bundle Identifier Consistency**: Use consistent bundle IDs across releases; changing IDs resets SmartScreen reputation
**Quarantine Testing**: Test notarized apps with quarantine attribute (xattr -p com.apple.quarantine) to verify Gatekeeper acceptance
**Notarization Logs**: Review notarization logs for warnings; address security issues flagged by Apple's automated analysis
**Archive Submissions**: Retain notarization submission receipts, RequestUUIDs, and responses for audit and troubleshooting
**Multi-Platform Strategy**: Coordinate notarization across platforms (macOS, Windows, Android); ensure consistent release timing
**Rollback Preparation**: Maintain previous notarized versions; if new notarization fails, can continue distributing prior approved version
**Monitoring & Alerts**: Monitor notarization failures; set up alerts for submission errors, malware detections, or expired certificates
**Documentation**: Document platform-specific requirements, entitlement justifications, and known false positive patterns

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
