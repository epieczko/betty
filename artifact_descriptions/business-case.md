# Name: business-case

## Executive Summary

The Business Case is a critical financial and strategic deliverable that provides quantitative justification for investment decisions using industry-standard financial analysis frameworks including Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), payback period analysis, and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) modeling. This artifact applies strategic frameworks such as Porter's Five Forces, Business Model Canvas, and Value Proposition Canvas to evaluate market positioning and competitive advantage.

As a foundational component of portfolio management and capital allocation, this artifact supports CFOs, Finance Teams, Product Managers, and Executive Leadership in making data-driven investment decisions. It incorporates sensitivity analysis, scenario planning (best/worst/most likely cases), break-even analysis, and risk-adjusted return calculations to provide comprehensive financial visibility. The business case leverages financial modeling tools, ROI calculators, and discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to quantify both CapEx and OpEx implications across multi-year planning horizons.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
