# Name: database-schema-ddl

## Executive Summary

Database Schema DDL (Data Definition Language) are version-controlled SQL scripts defining tables, columns, indexes, constraints, and relationships that constitute the database structure. Following database migration best practices (Flyway, Liquibase, Alembic), DDL scripts enable reproducible database provisioning, zero-downtime schema evolution, and rollback capabilities through sequential, idempotent migration files tracked in version control.

As the authoritative source of database structure, DDL scripts provide DBAs with deployment automation, developers with local development setup, DevOps teams with infrastructure-as-code database provisioning, and QA teams with consistent test environments. They transform manual database changes into automated, auditable, and reversible migrations.

### Strategic Importance

- **Zero-Downtime Migrations**: Enables expand-contract pattern for schema changes without application downtime
- **Environment Consistency**: Ensures dev, staging, and production schemas are identical through automated migrations
- **Rollback Capability**: Provides tested rollback scripts for each migration to enable rapid recovery
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of schema changes with who, when, why for compliance and debugging
- **Database as Code**: Treats schema as version-controlled code with peer review and CI/CD integration
- **Disaster Recovery**: Enables rapid database recreation from DDL scripts for DR scenarios
- **Performance Optimization**: Documents index strategy, partitioning, and performance-related schema decisions

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

Database Schema DDL scripts define database structure through version-controlled, sequential migration files (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, CREATE INDEX) enabling automated, repeatable, and reversible schema deployments across all environments.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Table definitions: Column names, data types, constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK)
- Primary keys: Single-column and composite primary keys
- Foreign keys: Relationships, referential integrity, cascade rules (ON DELETE CASCADE, ON UPDATE CASCADE)
- Indexes: B-tree indexes, unique indexes, partial indexes, covering indexes for query optimization
- Constraints: CHECK constraints, DEFAULT values, UNIQUE constraints
- Migration versioning: Sequential numbering (V001, V002) or timestamp-based (20240101_120000)
- Idempotency: IF NOT EXISTS, IF EXISTS checks for safe rerun capability
- Rollback scripts: Corresponding DOWN migrations for each UP migration
- Data type selection: INT vs BIGINT, VARCHAR vs TEXT, TIMESTAMP vs DATE
- Schema evolution: Expand-contract pattern, backward-compatible changes, breaking change handling

**Out of Scope**:
- Database stored procedures and functions (covered in Database Functions/Procedures)
- Data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE - covered in Data Migration Scripts)
- Database performance tuning configuration (covered in Database Configuration)
- Query optimization (covered in Query Performance Optimization)

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
