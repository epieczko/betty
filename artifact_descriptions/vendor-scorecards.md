# Name: vendor-scorecards

## Executive Summary

Vendor Scorecards are quantitative performance measurement artifacts tracking vendor service quality, SLA compliance, responsiveness, innovation, risk rating, and overall relationship health using weighted scoring methodologies aligned to balanced scorecard frameworks and vendor performance management best practices. This critical deliverable enables data-driven vendor management decisions including contract renewal/termination, performance improvement plans, strategic vendor designation, and vendor risk monitoring through objective metrics, trending analysis, and red/yellow/green health indicators.

As the authoritative vendor performance measurement framework, this artifact serves Vendor Managers, Procurement Teams, Business Owners, Executive Leadership, and Vendor Risk Teams by providing standardized KPIs, weighted scoring, trend analysis, comparative vendor benchmarking, and performance dashboards. It integrates with procurement platforms (SAP Ariba, Coupa), vendor management systems, and GRC platforms enabling automated scorecard generation, performance trend tracking, and vendor portfolio optimization.

### Strategic Importance

- **Quantitative Performance Metrics**: Establishes weighted KPIs across quality (30%), delivery/SLA compliance (25%), cost/value (20%), responsiveness (15%), innovation (5%), and risk rating (5%) providing objective performance measurement
- **SLA Compliance Tracking**: Monitors vendor SLA adherence calculating on-time delivery, service availability, response times, and resolution times with SLA credit tracking when thresholds breached
- **Relationship Health Scoring**: Provides overall vendor health rating (Red/Yellow/Green or 1-5 scale) combining performance metrics, risk rating, and relationship factors predicting vendor viability
- **Performance Trending**: Tracks vendor performance over time (quarterly/annually) identifying improving, declining, or stable vendors enabling proactive intervention
- **Vendor Tier Management**: Supports vendor tier assignment (Tier 1 Strategic, Tier 2 Preferred, Tier 3 Approved, Tier 4 Tactical) based on scorecard results with tiering influencing contract terms
- **Contract Decision Support**: Informs contract renewal decisions, performance improvement plan triggers (score <70%), and vendor termination recommendations (score <50%)
- **Vendor Benchmarking**: Enables comparative analysis across vendors in same category identifying best-in-class vendors and underperformers

**Trend Analysis**: Track scorecard trends over time (quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year) identifying improving, stable, or declining performance
**Vendor Benchmarking**: Compare vendors in same category against each other identifying best performers and setting performance targets
**Contract Decisions**: Use scorecards as primary input for renewal decisions (auto-renew if >85, renegotiate if 70-84, consider termination if <70)
**Strategic Vendor Program**: Require consistent scorecard >85 for strategic vendor program eligibility with benefits (longer terms, preferred pricing)
**Customization by Vendor Type**: Adjust KPI weights by vendor type (e.g., SaaS vendors emphasize availability, consulting vendors emphasize quality/responsiveness)
**Automation**: Automate scorecard calculation from source systems (service desk for ticket metrics, contract system for SLA data, invoice system for cost metrics)
**Executive Dashboard**: Provide executive vendor portfolio dashboard showing top/bottom performers and overall vendor health distribution
**Root Cause Analysis**: When scorecard declines, conduct root cause analysis to determine if vendor issue, scope change, or internal measurement problem
