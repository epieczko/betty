# Name: automated-test-scripts

## Executive Summary

The Automated Test Scripts artifact comprises executable test code implementing unit tests (JUnit, Jest, pytest, RSpec), integration tests, end-to-end tests (Selenium WebDriver, Cypress, Playwright, TestCafe), API tests (REST Assured, Postman/Newman, Pact), and BDD specifications (Cucumber, SpecFlow, Behave) with Gherkin syntax. These scripts execute in CI/CD pipelines to provide continuous validation of functionality, regression prevention, and quality feedback with target execution time <30 minutes for full suite.

As the executable foundation of quality automation, this artifact serves QA automation engineers, SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) roles, developers practicing TDD (Test-Driven Development), and DevOps engineers who integrate tests into deployment pipelines. Test scripts follow the test pyramid pattern (70% unit tests for fast feedback, 20% integration tests for component interaction, 10% E2E tests for critical user journeys), implement page object model (POM) design pattern for maintainability, use data-driven testing with parameterized inputs, include explicit waits and synchronization strategies, generate detailed test reports (Allure, ExtentReports, Mochawesome), and achieve 80%+ code coverage measured by JaCoCo, Istanbul, or Coverage.py.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
