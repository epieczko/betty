# Name: customer-communication-templates

## Executive Summary

The Customer Communication Templates provide legally-reviewed, pre-approved templates for notifying customers of security incidents, data breaches, service degradations, and compliance events that require mandatory disclosure. These templates ensure organizations meet regulatory notification deadlines (GDPR 72-hour breach notification, CCPA 45-day disclosure, state breach laws) while maintaining legal precision, customer trust, and brand protection during sensitive security events.

Security incident communication represents one of the highest-risk customer interactions, with legal implications for breach disclosure timing, content accuracy, and regulatory compliance. These templates balance legal requirements with customer empathy, providing clear guidance on what happened, who is affected, what actions customers should take, and what remediation steps the organization has implemented. Templates are differentiated by incident type (data breach, unauthorized access, ransomware, insider threat) and regulatory jurisdiction (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, state breach laws).

### Strategic Importance

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets mandatory breach notification deadlines (GDPR 72 hours, CCPA 45 days, HIPAA 60 days, state breach laws)
- **Legal Protection**: Uses legally-reviewed language to minimize liability exposure while maintaining transparency
- **Customer Trust**: Demonstrates accountability and transparency during security incidents, preserving long-term customer relationships
- **Brand Protection**: Maintains professional, empathetic communication tone during reputational crisis events
- **Data Subject Rights**: Fulfills GDPR Article 34 requirements for direct notification to affected individuals
- **Multi-Jurisdictional Compliance**: Addresses varying breach notification requirements across US states and international regulations
- **Incident Response Integration**: Coordinates customer communication with incident response, forensics, and legal counsel workflows

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact serves as the template library for all regulated customer notifications related to security incidents, data breaches, privacy violations, and compliance events. Templates ensure consistent, legally-compliant communication that meets regulatory notification requirements while providing affected customers with actionable guidance and remediation resources.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Data breach notifications (GDPR Article 34, CCPA Section 1798.82, HIPAA Breach Notification Rule)
- Security incident notifications (unauthorized access, credential compromise, malware infection)
- Service degradation notifications with security implications (availability incidents affecting data integrity)
- Regulatory authority notifications (GDPR supervisory authority within 72 hours, HHS Secretary for HIPAA)
- Data subject notifications (direct communication to affected individuals per GDPR/CCPA requirements)
- Vendor/subprocessor breach notifications (third-party security incidents affecting customer data)
- Multi-jurisdictional breach templates (US state breach laws: CA, NY, TX, FL + EU GDPR)
- Customer action guidance (password reset instructions, identity monitoring resources, fraud alert steps)
- Remediation and prevention communication (what we've done to prevent recurrence)

**Out of Scope**:
- Service availability incidents without security impact (covered in status page templates)
- Product feature announcements and updates (managed through product communications)
- General customer support communications (handled by customer success templates)
- Marketing and promotional communications (owned by marketing team)

## Best Practices

**Legal Review Mandatory**: All breach notifications must be reviewed and approved by legal counsel before sending (no exceptions)
**72-Hour GDPR Deadline**: For EU data breaches, notify supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware (clock starts when security team has reasonable certainty)
**No Speculation**: Only include confirmed facts in breach notifications; avoid speculation about attacker motives or unconfirmed impact
**Specific Date/Time Ranges**: Provide precise incident detection and containment timestamps in UTC (e.g., "March 15, 2025 14:23 UTC to March 15, 2025 18:47 UTC")
**Affected Data Categories**: Clearly list what data types were accessed (names, emails, passwords, payment info) - be specific, not vague
**Plain Language Requirement**: Write at 8th-grade reading level; avoid legal jargon and technical terms customers won't understand
**Actionable Customer Guidance**: Provide clear next steps (reset password, enable MFA, monitor credit, place fraud alert)
**Free Credit Monitoring**: For breaches involving SSN/financial data, offer 12-24 months free credit monitoring (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion)
**Dedicated Support Channel**: Establish dedicated email/phone line for breach-related inquiries (don't overwhelm normal support)
**Multi-Channel Notification**: Send via email (primary), in-app notification, and postal mail for high-risk breaches (HIPAA requires postal)
**Subject Line Clarity**: Use clear subject lines ("Important Security Notice" not "Account Update") to avoid spam filters
**No Minimization**: Don't downplay breach severity; be transparent about potential impact even if uncomfortable
**Timeline Honesty**: If investigation is ongoing, say so; provide investigation completion estimate if possible
**Regulatory Filing Evidence**: Retain proof of breach notification filing with regulatory authorities (timestamp, confirmation number)
**Customer FAQ Preparation**: Publish detailed FAQ addressing common questions before sending notification (reduces support burden)
**Executive Availability**: Ensure CISO/CEO available for high-profile breach inquiries and media requests
**Template Customization**: Customize template for specific incident details; don't send generic boilerplate
**Translation Requirements**: Translate notifications to languages used by affected customers (EU multilingual requirements)
**Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure breach notifications meet ADA/WCAG accessibility standards for disabled individuals
**Opt-Out Prohibition**: Never include "unsubscribe" links in breach notifications (legally required communication)
