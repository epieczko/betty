# Name: operational-acceptance-certificate

## Executive Summary

The Operational Acceptance Certificate is a production readiness validation artifact that verifies systems meet operational excellence criteria before SRE/Operations teams assume ongoing support responsibility. This document ensures comprehensive monitoring coverage, validated runbooks, tested disaster recovery procedures, defined SLOs/SLAs, and verified incident response capabilities align with Google SRE production readiness review standards and ITIL service transition requirements.

The certificate represents formal handoff from development/project teams to operational support, confirming all observability instrumentation, automated remediation, capacity planning, security hardening, and documentation meet enterprise operational standards. It validates successful completion of chaos engineering experiments, load testing at production scale, failover testing, and backup/restore procedures. This artifact satisfies SOC 2 availability controls, supports ISO 20000 service management compliance, and provides evidence that operations teams have the tools, knowledge, and automation required to maintain service reliability and meet customer SLA commitments.

## Best Practices

**SLO-First Approach**: Define measurable SLOs (e.g., 99.9% availability, p95 latency <200ms) before system launch, not after incidents occur
**Monitoring Coverage Validation**: Verify instrumentation for all critical user journeys with synthetic monitoring and real user monitoring (RUM)
**Runbook Walkthrough**: Require operations team to successfully execute every runbook procedure before sign-off acceptance
**Chaos Engineering**: Conduct chaos experiments (e.g., pod failures, network partitions, zone outages) and verify system resilience
**Load Testing at Scale**: Test at 150% of projected peak load to validate performance under stress conditions
**Disaster Recovery Testing**: Execute complete DR failover and failback at least once before production go-live
**Dependency Mapping**: Document all upstream/downstream dependencies with failure mode and fallback strategies
**Alert Tuning**: Verify alerts are actionable, properly routed, and don't cause alert fatigue through testing and threshold tuning
**Backup Validation**: Test backup restore procedures to verify data integrity and meet RPO/RTO requirements
**Security Hardening Checklist**: Apply CIS benchmarks, disable unnecessary services, implement least privilege access
**Cost Transparency**: Provide detailed cost breakdown for compute, storage, data transfer, and third-party services
**Knowledge Transfer Sessions**: Conduct hands-on training with operations team covering architecture, troubleshooting, and escalation
**Graduated Rollout**: Use canary deployments or progressive rollout to detect issues before full production exposure
**Error Budget Policy**: Establish clear error budget policies defining when to halt new feature development for reliability work
**On-Call Rotation Setup**: Configure PagerDuty/Opsgenie rotations with primary and secondary escalation paths
**Dashboards for Every Service**: Create Grafana/Datadog dashboards showing SLIs, error rates, latency, and saturation metrics
**Documented Escalation Paths**: Clearly identify when to escalate to development teams, vendors, or incident commanders
**Capacity Headroom**: Ensure 30-50% headroom above current load to handle traffic spikes without degradation
**Automated Remediation**: Implement self-healing for common failure modes (auto-restart, auto-scale, circuit breakers)
**Post-Launch Review**: Schedule 30-day post-launch review to validate operational readiness assumptions and identify gaps

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
