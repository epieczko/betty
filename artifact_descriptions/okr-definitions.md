# Name: okr-definitions

## Executive Summary

OKR Definitions establish the Objectives and Key Results framework that drives goal-setting, strategic alignment, and performance measurement across product teams and the organization. Grounded in the methodology popularized by John Doerr's "Measure What Matters" and practiced at companies like Google, Intel, and LinkedIn, this artifact defines quarterly or annual objectives (the qualitative "what") and key results (the quantitative "how we measure success").

This framework creates a cascading alignment from company-level OKRs to product OKRs to team OKRs, ensuring every initiative connects to strategic priorities. Product Managers, Product Leaders, and Strategy Teams use this artifact to set ambitious goals (typically 70% achievement is considered success), track progress through weekly check-ins, and grade results on a 0.0-1.0 scale at quarter-end. Tools like Lattice, 15Five, Ally.io, Perdoo, or simple spreadsheets facilitate OKR tracking, while frameworks like the North Star Metric help identify the most impactful objectives.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Best Practices

**Version Control**: Store in centralized version control system (Git, SharePoint with versioning, etc.) to maintain complete history and enable rollback
**Naming Conventions**: Follow organization's document naming standards for consistency and discoverability
**Template Usage**: Use approved templates to ensure completeness and consistency across teams
**Peer Review**: Have at least one qualified peer review before submitting for approval
**Metadata Completion**: Fully complete all metadata fields to enable search, classification, and lifecycle management
**Stakeholder Validation**: Review draft with key stakeholders before finalizing to ensure alignment and buy-in
**Plain Language**: Write in clear, concise language appropriate for the intended audience; avoid unnecessary jargon
**Visual Communication**: Include diagrams, charts, and tables to communicate complex information more effectively
**Traceability**: Reference source materials, related documents, and dependencies to provide context and enable navigation
**Regular Updates**: Review and update on scheduled cadence or when triggered by significant changes

**Distribution Management**: Clearly communicate where artifact is published and notify stakeholders of updates
**Retention Compliance**: Follow organizational retention policies for how long to maintain and when to archive/destroy
**Market Validation**: Validate assumptions with market research and customer feedback
**Financial Rigor**: Use discounted cash flow, NPV, and scenario analysis for financial projections
**Competitive Intelligence**: Incorporate competitive analysis and market positioning
**Focus**: Limit to 3-5 objectives per team/level; more OKRs dilute focus and execution
**Measurable Key Results**: Ensure every KR is quantitative and measurable (not "launch feature X")
**Ambitious Goals**: Set stretch goals where 70% achievement is considered success (not 100% sandbagging)
**Outcome-Oriented**: Focus key results on outcomes (impact), not outputs (activities or features shipped)
**Alignment Cascading**: Ensure team OKRs ladder up to product OKRs, which ladder up to company OKRs
**Transparency**: Make OKRs visible across the organization to enable coordination and alignment
**Weekly Check-ins**: Track progress weekly or bi-weekly; don't wait until quarter-end to discover you're off track
**Grading Discipline**: Grade OKRs honestly on 0.0-1.0 scale at quarter-end; use learnings for next quarter
**Committed vs. Stretch**: Distinguish between committed OKRs (90%+ expected) and stretch/aspirational (60-70%)
**Ownership Clarity**: Assign clear DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) for each objective and key result
**Cross-Functional**: Collaborate across Product, Engineering, Design, Marketing on shared OKRs
**North Star Alignment**: Tie product OKRs to North Star Metric when applicable
**Bottom-Up Input**: Combine top-down strategic objectives with bottom-up team input during planning

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
