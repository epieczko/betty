# Name: installer-manifests

## Executive Summary

Installer Manifests are packaged, versioned deployment artifacts that encapsulate complex application and infrastructure installations through standardized formats including Helm charts, Kubernetes Operators, Carvel packages, and OLM (Operator Lifecycle Manager) bundles. These manifests provide repeatable, auditable, and upgradable deployment mechanisms that abstract the complexity of multi-resource Kubernetes applications into cohesive, manageable units.

As cloud-native packaging standards, installer manifests enable organizations to distribute internal platform services, third-party software, and complex stateful applications with embedded lifecycle management, dependency resolution, upgrade paths, and rollback capabilities. They form the foundation of application catalogs, platform service offerings, and GitOps-based continuous delivery pipelines.

### Strategic Importance

- **Repeatable Installations**: Ensures consistent deployment across environments, clusters, and clouds
- **Lifecycle Management**: Provides automated upgrade, rollback, and uninstall capabilities
- **Dependency Resolution**: Manages complex application dependencies and prerequisites automatically
- **Version Control**: Enables semantic versioning of application packages with upgrade compatibility matrices
- **Configuration Management**: Supports parameterized installations through values files and overlays
- **Security & Compliance**: Enables scanning, signing, and validation of packaged artifacts before deployment
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Leverages community charts, operators, and packages while maintaining organizational customizations

## Purpose & Scope

## Best Practices

**Semantic Versioning**: Follow SemVer (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for chart/package versions with clear upgrade compatibility
**Values Schema**: Define values.schema.json for Helm charts to validate user-provided configurations
**Comprehensive Docs**: Include README.md with installation instructions, configuration options, and troubleshooting guides
**Default Security**: Embed security best practices in default values (resource limits, security contexts, network policies)
**Dependency Pinning**: Pin chart/package dependencies to specific versions for reproducibility
**Testing Automation**: Implement automated testing in CI pipelines (helm lint, chart-testing, operator scorecard)
**Upgrade Paths**: Document and test upgrade paths from previous versions, including breaking changes
**Rollback Support**: Ensure installations are rollback-safe with proper resource cleanup
**Secrets Externalization**: Never include secrets in charts; use external-secrets or sealed-secrets patterns
**Resource Requests**: Include sensible default resource requests/limits for all workloads
**GitOps Compatible**: Design charts to work seamlessly with ArgoCD and Flux
**Minimal Values**: Keep default values minimal; use values for environment-specific overrides only
**Idempotent Operations**: Ensure installations and upgrades are idempotent and can be safely retried
**Health Checks**: Include liveness and readiness probes for all deployments
**Monitoring Integration**: Bundle ServiceMonitor resources for Prometheus integration
**OCI Storage**: Store Helm charts in OCI registries for standardized artifact management
**Signed Packages**: Sign charts and operator bundles for supply chain security
**Version Matrix**: Document compatibility matrix (Kubernetes versions, dependencies, operators)
**Pre-flight Checks**: Implement validation to check cluster prerequisites before installation
**Namespace Scoping**: Make charts namespace-scoped by default, support cluster-wide installation as option

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
