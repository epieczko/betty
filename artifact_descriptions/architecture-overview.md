# Name: architecture-overview

## Executive Summary

The Architecture Overview is a comprehensive technical artifact that documents the complete architectural landscape of a system or solution using industry-standard frameworks and modeling techniques. This artifact leverages the C4 Model (Context, Containers, Components, Code) for hierarchical decomposition, Kruchten's 4+1 View Model for multi-perspective analysis, and quality attribute scenarios from SEI to capture both functional and non-functional requirements.

Using tools like Structurizr for diagrams-as-code, PlantUML for UML diagrams, or Archi for ArchiMate 3.1 modeling, the architecture overview provides a complete picture spanning system context, container architecture, component design, and code structure. It addresses ISO 25010 quality attributes including performance efficiency, security, reliability, maintainability, and scalability while documenting architectural patterns such as microservices, hexagonal architecture, CQRS/event sourcing, and strangler fig migration strategies.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects

## Best Practices

**Diagrams-as-Code**: Use Structurizr DSL, PlantUML, or Mermaid to version control diagrams alongside documentation; enables automated rendering and consistency
**C4 Model Hierarchy**: Start with System Context (Level 1) for stakeholder communication, drill down to Container (Level 2) for system decomposition, Component (Level 3) for design, Code (Level 4) only when necessary
**Multiple Perspectives**: Document all 4+1 views - logical (what), process (how/when), development (organization), physical (where), scenarios (why) - to address different stakeholder concerns
**Quality Attribute Scenarios**: Define measurable quality requirements using SEI's three-part format: source-stimulus → architectural element → response-measure (e.g., "User requests web page → Load balancer → 95th percentile <2 seconds")
**ADR Documentation**: Capture significant architecture decisions in lightweight Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) using Michael Nygard's template (context, decision, consequences, status)
**Consistent Notation**: Use ArchiMate 3.1 notation for enterprise architecture, UML 2.5 for software design, BPMN 2.0 for processes; document notation legend in each diagram
**Technology Radar**: Maintain ThoughtWorks-style technology radar (adopt, trial, assess, hold) for technology choices and evolution
**Pattern Documentation**: Explicitly identify architectural patterns used (microservices, CQRS, event sourcing, hexagonal) with rationale and trade-offs
**Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Document security architecture, data architecture, integration architecture, and observability strategy separately for clarity
**Constraint Documentation**: Clearly separate architectural decisions from imposed constraints (regulatory, organizational, technical debt)
**Tool Consistency**: Standardize on organization-approved tools (Structurizr, Archi, Enterprise Architect) for diagram creation and maintenance
**Version Control**: Store diagrams-as-code in Git alongside documentation; use conventional commits for change tracking
**Peer Review**: Conduct architecture peer reviews with other architects before ARB submission
**Stakeholder Validation**: Walk through each view with relevant stakeholders - business owners for context, developers for components, operations for deployment
**Regular Updates**: Update architecture overview when significant changes occur; maintain "living documentation" rather than point-in-time snapshots
**Cloud-Native Patterns**: For cloud deployments, reference AWS/Azure/GCP Well-Architected Framework pillars and document alignment
**Validation**: Verify architecture against quality attribute scenarios through prototyping, proof-of-concepts, or architectural fitness functions

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
