# Name: service-mesh-configurations

## Executive Summary

Service Mesh Configurations define the sophisticated traffic management, security, and observability policies that govern service-to-service communication within distributed microservices architectures. Built on platforms like Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect, and AWS App Mesh, these configurations implement advanced patterns including intelligent routing, circuit breaking, mutual TLS (mTLS), fault injection, and distributed tracing without requiring application code changes.

The service mesh operates as a dedicated infrastructure layer that abstracts networking complexity from application developers while providing platform teams with centralized control over security policies, traffic behavior, and observability instrumentation. This separation of concerns enables organizations to enforce zero-trust security, implement sophisticated deployment strategies (canary, blue-green, A/B testing), and gain deep visibility into distributed system behavior.

### Strategic Importance

- **Zero-Trust Security**: Enforces mutual TLS (mTLS) for all service-to-service communication with automatic certificate rotation
- **Traffic Management**: Enables advanced routing, load balancing, retries, timeouts, and circuit breaking without code changes
- **Progressive Delivery**: Supports canary releases, blue-green deployments, and traffic mirroring for safe rollouts
- **Observability Excellence**: Provides automatic distributed tracing, metrics collection, and service topology visualization
- **Multi-Cluster & Multi-Cloud**: Facilitates service communication across Kubernetes clusters and cloud providers
- **Fault Resilience**: Implements chaos engineering patterns through fault injection and failure simulation
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets requirements for encryption in transit, audit logging, and service access controls

## Best Practices

**Enable mTLS by Default**: Enforce mutual TLS for all service-to-service communication with STRICT mode
**Progressive Rollout**: Use canary deployments with automated analysis before full production rollout
**GitOps Management**: Store all service mesh configurations in Git and deploy via ArgoCD/Flux with automated validation
**Namespace Isolation**: Apply service mesh policies at namespace boundaries to enforce tenant isolation
**Least Privilege Authorization**: Use AuthorizationPolicy to enforce fine-grained access control based on service identity
**Resource Limits**: Configure sidecar proxy resource requests and limits to prevent resource exhaustion
**Observability First**: Enable distributed tracing and metrics collection before moving to production
**Circuit Breaker Configuration**: Implement outlier detection to prevent cascading failures
**Timeout Policies**: Set appropriate timeouts for all service calls with retry budgets
**Test Fault Injection**: Regularly test resilience patterns using fault injection in non-production environments
**Gateway Hardening**: Secure ingress gateways with rate limiting, WAF integration, and DDoS protection
**Certificate Management**: Automate certificate rotation with reasonable TTLs (24 hours or less)
**Sidecar Injection Strategy**: Use namespace-level auto-injection with explicit opt-out rather than opt-in
**Performance Monitoring**: Monitor proxy CPU/memory usage and latency impact of service mesh
**Version Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility between control plane and data plane (sidecar) versions
**Gradual Migration**: Migrate services to service mesh incrementally, not all at once
**ServiceEntry Management**: Explicitly declare external dependencies using ServiceEntry for better visibility
**Header Propagation**: Ensure distributed tracing headers are propagated through all service calls
**Envoy Filter Caution**: Use custom Envoy filters sparingly and test thoroughly before production
**Documentation**: Document traffic routing logic, security policies, and troubleshooting runbooks

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
