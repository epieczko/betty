# Name: feature-rollback-playbooks

## Executive Summary

Feature Rollback Playbooks are prescriptive operational procedures that enable rapid, safe reversal of problematic deployments, feature releases, or configuration changes when issues are detected in production. These critical safety mechanisms provide step-by-step rollback instructions including code reversion, database migration rollbacks, feature flag disabling, traffic shifting, and validation smoke tests, minimizing customer impact and reducing MTTR during deployment-related incidents.

Aligned with SRE deployment best practices and DevOps continuous delivery principles, these playbooks integrate with deployment tools (Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Spinnaker, Jenkins), feature flag platforms (LaunchDarkly, Split.io, Unleash), and infrastructure-as-code systems (Terraform, CloudFormation) to enable both automated and manual rollback procedures. Each playbook includes pre-rollback safety checks, rollback execution steps, validation procedures, database migration handling, and communication protocols for coordinating rollbacks across distributed teams.

### Strategic Importance

- **Rapid Recovery**: Reduces deployment-related MTTR by 70-90% through pre-tested rollback procedures
- **Blast Radius Limitation**: Minimizes customer impact by quickly reverting problematic changes
- **Safe Deployment Culture**: Enables teams to deploy confidently knowing rollback is fast and reliable
- **Progressive Delivery**: Supports canary deployments, blue-green deployments, and gradual rollouts with quick rollback
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures database schema changes can be safely reverted without data loss
- **Compliance**: Satisfies change management requirements for documented rollback procedures
- **Incident Prevention**: Catches deployment issues early through automated smoke tests and canary analysis

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact provides tested, executable procedures for safely rolling back deployments, feature releases, and configuration changes when production issues are detected. It solves the problem of deployment-related incidents by enabling rapid reversion to known-good states, minimizing customer impact, and providing clear decision criteria for when to rollback versus rollforward.

- Infrastructure rollback (Terraform revert, CloudFormation stack updates, Kubernetes deployments)
- Configuration rollback (config file reversion, environment variable changes)
- Traffic shifting and canary rollback (blue-green deployments, weighted traffic routing)
- Pre-rollback safety checks (backup verification, dependency validation)
- Post-rollback validation (smoke tests, health checks, customer impact verification)
- Communication protocols (notifying teams, updating status pages, documenting rollback reason)
- Rollback vs. rollforward decision criteria

## Best Practices

**Test Rollback First**: Always test rollback procedures in staging before relying on them in production
**Automate Rollback**: Prefer automated rollback triggers (kubectl rollout undo) over manual procedures
**Feature Flags First**: Use feature flags for instant rollback without redeployment when possible
**Database Backward Compatibility**: Design migrations to be backward-compatible for safe rollback
**Pre-Rollback Checks**: Verify backup exists, dependencies are stable, rollback target version is available
**Clear Decision Criteria**: Define specific thresholds triggering rollback (error rate > 5%, latency > 2x baseline)
**Communication Protocol**: Notify teams immediately when rollback initiated; update status page
**Smoke Test Validation**: Always run smoke tests after rollback to verify system health
**Rollback Time Target**: Aim for <5 minute rollback execution time from decision to completion
**Database Rollback Scripts**: Maintain tested DOWN migration scripts for all schema changes
**Version Pinning**: Maintain ability to rollback to specific version, not just "previous"
**Canary First**: Deploy to canary environment first; auto-rollback if canary metrics degrade
**Blue-Green Strategy**: Maintain previous version running for instant traffic shift rollback
**Document Rollback Reason**: Always document why rollback was needed for post-mortem analysis
**Practice Regularly**: Execute rollback procedures quarterly in non-prod to ensure they work
**Rollback vs. Rollforward**: Define criteria; sometimes fixing forward is faster than rolling back
**Dependency Coordination**: Plan rollback order for services with dependencies (reverse of deployment order)

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
