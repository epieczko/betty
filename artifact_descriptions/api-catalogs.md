# Name: api-catalogs

## Executive Summary

The API Catalog is a comprehensive inventory and documentation system that centralizes all organizational APIs, providing a single source of truth for API discovery, governance, and lifecycle management. This artifact enables API-first strategy by documenting REST, GraphQL, gRPC, SOAP, and event-driven APIs with complete OpenAPI 3.1, AsyncAPI, or GraphQL schema specifications.

As the foundation of API governance and developer experience, this catalog drives API reusability, consistency, and discoverability across the enterprise. It integrates with API gateways (Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management, Tyk, MuleSoft Anypoint), developer portals (Stoplight, Redoc, Swagger UI, ReadMe), and API management platforms to provide complete visibility into the API ecosystem, versioning strategies, deprecation timelines, SLA commitments, and consumer relationships.

### Strategic Importance

- **API Discovery & Reusability**: Prevents duplicate API development through centralized catalog of existing capabilities
- **Developer Experience**: Accelerates integration through searchable catalog with interactive documentation
- **Governance & Compliance**: Ensures API standards adherence, security policies, and regulatory compliance
- **Lifecycle Management**: Tracks APIs from design through deprecation with version control and change management
- **Business Enablement**: Enables API monetization, partner ecosystems, and platform business models
- **Operational Excellence**: Supports dependency analysis, impact assessment, and incident response

## Best Practices

**API-First Strategy**: Register APIs during design phase before implementation, enabling contract-first development
**Complete Specifications**: Provide full OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/GraphQL schemas with examples, descriptions, and error responses
**Automated Synchronization**: Integrate catalog with CI/CD pipelines to auto-update from source repositories and API gateways
**Semantic Versioning**: Use SemVer (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) consistently across all APIs for predictable evolution
**Deprecation Lifecycle**: Define clear deprecation timelines (typically 6-12 months) with sunset dates and migration paths
**Interactive Documentation**: Leverage Swagger UI, Redoc, or Stoplight for "try it out" functionality in developer portals
**Search & Discovery**: Implement full-text search, tagging, and categorization for easy API discovery
**Dependency Mapping**: Document upstream and downstream dependencies to assess impact of changes
**SLA Documentation**: Clearly define response times, availability commitments, rate limits, and support tiers
**Authentication Guidance**: Provide clear instructions for obtaining credentials and implementing OAuth/API key flows
**Code Examples**: Include SDK examples in multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, .NET)
**Change Notifications**: Implement automated notifications for breaking changes, deprecations, and new versions
**Consumer Tracking**: Maintain registry of API consumers with contact information for targeted communications
**Health Indicators**: Display real-time API status, uptime metrics, and incident history
**Governance Alignment**: Enforce API design standards through automated linting (Spectral, API Linter)
**Security Classification**: Tag APIs by data classification (public, internal, confidential, restricted)
**Environment Separation**: Document endpoints for all environments (sandbox, dev, staging, production)
**Feedback Mechanisms**: Enable developer feedback channels for API improvements
**Analytics Integration**: Track API adoption, usage patterns, and performance metrics
**Regular Audits**: Quarterly review to identify orphaned APIs, unused endpoints, and consolidation opportunities

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
