# Name: interactive-prototypes

## Executive Summary

Interactive Prototypes are dynamic, functional demonstrations of data visualizations, analytics applications, or data-driven features that enable stakeholders to experience proposed solutions before full development. Unlike static mockups, these prototypes support user interaction, data exploration, and workflow simulation, providing critical validation for UX decisions, technical feasibility, and business value.

In data and analytics initiatives, interactive prototypes bridge the gap between conceptual designs and production systems. They allow business users to validate dashboard layouts, test drill-down patterns, explore filtering mechanisms, and confirm that proposed analytics capabilities meet real-world needs. This early validation prevents costly rework and ensures solutions align with user expectations.

### Strategic Importance

- **Risk Mitigation**: Validates design assumptions and technical approaches before significant development investment
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Creates shared understanding through tangible demonstrations rather than abstract specifications
- **User-Centered Design**: Enables early user feedback to refine interactions, workflows, and information architecture
- **Technical Validation**: Proves feasibility of data integrations, performance requirements, and visualization approaches
- **Accelerated Delivery**: Reduces development cycles by identifying issues early and building consensus quickly

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
