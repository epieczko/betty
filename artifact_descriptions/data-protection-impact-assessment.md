# Name: data-protection-impact-assessment

## Executive Summary

The Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a mandatory privacy governance artifact required by GDPR Article 35 and other global privacy regulations when processing personal data presents high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms. Following ICO, CNIL, and EDPB guidance, this assessment systematically identifies privacy risks, evaluates necessity and proportionality, and documents mitigation measures to ensure lawful, fair, and transparent data processing.

As a cornerstone of Privacy by Design and Default (GDPR Article 25), the DPIA provides Data Protection Officers with evidence of compliance, privacy engineers with specific technical safeguards to implement, and executive leadership with risk-informed decisions on whether to proceed with, modify, or halt data processing activities. It serves as both a compliance requirement and a practical tool for embedding privacy protection into systems and processes.

### Strategic Importance

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Mandatory under GDPR Article 35 for high-risk processing; required before processing begins
- **Privacy Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks to individuals' privacy, freedom, and fundamental rights
- **Accountability Demonstration**: Provides documented evidence of GDPR compliance for supervisory authority audits
- **Penalty Avoidance**: Prevents fines up to €20M or 4% of global revenue for failure to conduct required DPIAs
- **Privacy by Design**: Embeds data protection into system architecture and business processes from inception
- **Stakeholder Trust**: Demonstrates organizational commitment to privacy protection and ethical data use
- **Cross-Border Compliance**: Satisfies similar requirements under CCPA, LGPD, PIPEDA, and other global privacy laws

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

The DPIA systematically assesses whether planned data processing activities present high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms, evaluates the necessity and proportionality of processing, identifies privacy risks and mitigation measures, and documents the decision-making process for regulatory accountability and supervisory authority consultation when required.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Necessity and proportionality assessment: Legal basis, purpose limitation, data minimization evaluation
- High-risk trigger analysis: Automated decision-making, large-scale profiling, special category data, biometric data, systematic monitoring
- Data flow mapping: Personal data categories, processing activities, data subjects, recipients, international transfers
- Privacy risk identification: Risks to confidentiality, integrity, availability, and individual rights
- Technical and organizational measures: Pseudonymization, encryption, access controls, retention limits
- Data subject rights: Access, rectification, erasure, data portability, objection mechanisms
- Third-party risk assessment: Processor DPIAs, vendor privacy due diligence
- Consultation requirements: When to consult supervisory authority for high residual risk

**Out of Scope**:
- General cybersecurity risk assessment (covered in Threat Model, Risk Assessment)
- Detailed technical security controls (covered in Security Architecture)
- Data retention policy details (covered in Data Retention Plan)

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
