# Name: rate-limiting-policy

## Executive Summary

The Rate Limiting Policy is a formal governance directive that establishes organizational standards for API throttling, quota management, and abuse prevention across all internal APIs, public APIs, partner integrations, and third-party API consumption. This policy defines rate limiting algorithms (token bucket, leaky bucket, fixed window, sliding window, GCRA), quota tiers, burst allowances, and enforcement mechanisms implemented through API gateways (Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway, Azure APIM) and application-level libraries.

As a cornerstone of API operational stability and fair resource allocation, this policy protects backend services from overload, prevents abuse and DDoS attacks, ensures equitable resource distribution among consumers, and enables API monetization through tiered pricing models. It mandates rate limiting implementation with specific algorithms, defines quota structures (requests per second/minute/day), specifies HTTP response headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, Retry-After), and establishes procedures for quota increases, exemptions, and violation responses.

### Strategic Importance

- **Service Protection**: Prevents API overload protecting backend systems from excessive traffic and resource exhaustion
- **Fair Resource Allocation**: Ensures equitable access preventing single consumers from monopolizing resources
- **Cost Management**: Controls infrastructure costs by limiting resource consumption per consumer
- **Abuse Prevention**: Detects and blocks malicious actors, scrapers, and DDoS attacks
- **Quality of Service**: Maintains consistent performance for all consumers through controlled load
- **Monetization Enabler**: Supports tiered pricing models (free, basic, premium) with different quota limits
- **SLA Protection**: Ensures service can meet SLO commitments by controlling request volume

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This policy establishes mandatory requirements for rate limiting all organizational APIs to protect services from overload, ensure fair resource allocation, prevent abuse, and enable API monetization. It solves the challenge of balancing API availability with resource constraints by defining quota limits, rate limiting algorithms, burst allowances, and enforcement mechanisms that protect infrastructure while providing predictable, documented limits to API consumers.

- Application-level rate limiting: Redis-based rate limiting, in-memory rate limiters, distributed rate limiting
- Rate limit keys: By API key, by IP address, by user ID, by OAuth client ID, by tenant ID
- HTTP response headers: X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset, Retry-After
- HTTP status codes: 429 Too Many Requests, error response format
- Quota enforcement: Hard limits (reject requests), soft limits (warnings), dynamic throttling

## Best Practices

**Token Bucket Recommended**: Use token bucket algorithm for most APIs - allows bursts while enforcing sustained rate
**Per-Consumer Rate Limiting**: Rate limit by API key, user ID, or tenant - not just by IP address
**Multiple Time Windows**: Implement rate limits at multiple granularities (per second, minute, hour, day)
**Generous Free Tier**: Provide meaningful free tier quota for developers to build and test integrations
**Clear Documentation**: Publish rate limits prominently in API documentation with examples
**Standard Response Headers**: Always return X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset headers
**HTTP 429 Status Code**: Use standard 429 Too Many Requests status code for rate limit violations
**Retry-After Header**: Include Retry-After header indicating when consumer can retry
**Descriptive Error Messages**: Provide clear error messages explaining which limit was exceeded and how to resolve
**Burst Allowance**: Allow short bursts above sustained rate (e.g., 100 RPS sustained, 150 RPS burst for 10 seconds)
**Distributed Rate Limiting**: Use Redis or similar for distributed rate limiting across multiple API gateway instances
**Monitoring & Alerting**: Track rate limit violations and alert on unusual patterns indicating abuse
**Gradual Rollout**: Implement rate limits gradually - start with monitoring, then warnings, then enforcement
**Tiered Quota Models**: Offer multiple tiers (free, basic, premium, enterprise) aligned with business model
**Quota Increase Process**: Define clear, documented process for requesting quota increases
**Whitelisting Capability**: Provide mechanism to whitelist trusted consumers from rate limits
**Per-Endpoint Limits**: Consider different rate limits for expensive vs. cheap operations
**GraphQL Cost Analysis**: For GraphQL, implement query cost calculation and cost-based rate limiting
**Respect External Limits**: When calling third-party APIs, implement rate limiting to stay within their quotas
**Circuit Breaker Integration**: Combine rate limiting with circuit breakers for comprehensive resilience
