# Name: performance-test-plan

## Executive Summary

The Performance Test Plan is a comprehensive testing artifact that defines performance benchmarks, load testing strategies, and validation criteria to ensure systems meet latency, throughput, and scalability requirements under expected and peak loads. This plan establishes rigorous testing protocols using industry-standard tools to identify performance bottlenecks, validate capacity plans, and ensure production readiness before release.

As a foundational quality assurance deliverable, it defines test scenarios for load testing, stress testing, endurance testing, and spike testing using tools like JMeter, k6, Gatling, and Locust. The plan establishes performance SLOs (p50/p95/p99 latency targets, throughput requirements), defines realistic test data and traffic patterns, and provides analysis methodologies to identify performance regressions and scalability limits.

### Strategic Importance

- **Production Readiness**: Validates systems can handle expected traffic loads with acceptable performance
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Discovers performance constraints and scalability limits before production impact
- **SLO Validation**: Ensures latency, throughput, and availability meet defined Service Level Objectives
- **Capacity Validation**: Confirms infrastructure sizing and auto-scaling policies support growth projections
- **Regression Prevention**: Detects performance degradations introduced by code or infrastructure changes

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
