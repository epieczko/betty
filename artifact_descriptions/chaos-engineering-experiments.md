# Name: chaos-engineering-experiments

## Executive Summary

Chaos Engineering Experiments are controlled, hypothesis-driven tests that inject failures into production or production-like systems to discover weaknesses before they manifest as outages. These experiments are essential for validating system resilience, improving MTTR, and building confidence in complex distributed systems aligned with Google SRE and chaos engineering principles.

Modern chaos engineering leverages specialized platforms (Chaos Monkey, Gremlin, Litmus Chaos, Chaos Mesh) to systematically inject failures—network latency, service crashes, resource exhaustion, dependency failures—while carefully monitoring system behavior and user impact. By proactively discovering failure modes in controlled conditions, teams reduce blast radius, improve incident response, and build antifragile systems that improve under stress.

### Strategic Importance

- **Proactive Failure Discovery**: Identify weaknesses before they cause customer-impacting outages
- **MTTR Improvement**: Reduce Mean Time To Recovery through practiced failure scenarios and runbook validation
- **Resilience Validation**: Verify that redundancy, failover, and circuit breakers work as designed
- **Error Budget Management**: Validate SLO adherence under degraded conditions and failure scenarios
- **GameDay Preparation**: Train incident response teams through realistic failure simulation
- **Blast Radius Containment**: Verify that failures are properly isolated and don't cascade
- **Confidence Building**: Increase confidence in system reliability through empirical testing

## Best Practices

**Start Small**: Begin with smallest possible blast radius (single instance, 1% traffic, test environment)
**Hypothesis First**: Always define clear hypothesis and success criteria before running experiments
**Monitor Everything**: Ensure comprehensive monitoring (metrics, logs, traces) before injecting failures
**Automated Rollback**: Implement automatic abort triggers based on SLO breaches or error rate thresholds
**Business Hours Only**: Run initial experiments during business hours with full team availability
**Notify On-Call**: Alert incident response teams before running production chaos experiments
**Document Runbooks**: Validate incident runbooks exist before testing failure scenarios
**Progressive Rollout**: Increase blast radius gradually (1% → 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
**Time Limits**: Set maximum experiment duration with automatic termination
**Kill Switch Ready**: Have manual abort procedure immediately available during experiments
**GameDay Practice**: Run team GameDays to practice incident response before real chaos
**Blameless Culture**: Treat failures discovered as learning opportunities, not blame assignments
**Measure MTTR**: Track Mean Time To Recovery during experiments to validate incident response
**Chaos as Code**: Store chaos experiment definitions in version control (GitOps approach)
**Continuous Chaos**: Progress from manual experiments to automated, continuous chaos in production
**Safety First**: Never compromise safety; abort immediately if unexpected impact observed
**Validate Alerts**: Ensure monitoring alerts fire correctly during experiments
**Test Runbooks**: Use chaos to validate and improve incident response runbooks
**Cross-Team Coordination**: Coordinate with all teams that might be affected by experiments
**Learn and Improve**: Document every failure discovered and track remediation to completion

   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version
