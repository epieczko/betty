# Name: evaluation-protocols

## Executive Summary

The Evaluation Protocols artifact defines standardized methodologies for evaluating machine learning models, AI systems, and data products throughout their lifecycle. This artifact establishes consistent evaluation metrics, test datasets, validation procedures, performance thresholds, and fairness assessments that ensure models meet quality, accuracy, bias, and safety requirements before deployment to production.

As ML systems become increasingly critical to business operations, rigorous evaluation protocols prevent model degradation, bias amplification, and performance failures. This artifact specifies offline evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC, RMSE), online evaluation strategies (A/B tests, shadow mode, canary deployments), fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds), and monitoring thresholds that trigger model retraining or rollback. It ensures model evaluation is reproducible, auditable, and aligned with business objectives and ethical AI principles.

## Best Practices

**Establish Baselines**: Always compare against simple baseline models (random, most-frequent, mean prediction) before deploying complex models
**Multiple Metrics**: Use multiple complementary metrics; single metric optimization can hide important model weaknesses
**Stratified Evaluation**: Report metrics broken down by key segments (demographics, geography, time periods) to detect bias
**Temporal Validation**: Use time-based train/test splits for time-series or sequential data to prevent data leakage
**Calibration Checks**: Verify predicted probabilities are well-calibrated using reliability diagrams and Brier scores
**Threshold Optimization**: Tune decision thresholds separately from model training to optimize business objectives
**Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Examine full confusion matrix, not just aggregate metrics, to understand error patterns
**Error Analysis**: Systematically analyze misclassifications to identify systematic weaknesses and improvement opportunities
**Fairness Audits**: Conduct comprehensive fairness assessments across protected attributes before production deployment
**Online-Offline Correlation**: Validate that offline metrics correlate with online business metrics through backtesting
**Shadow Mode Testing**: Deploy new models in shadow mode first to collect predictions without impacting users
**Gradual Rollout**: Use canary deployments (1%, 5%, 25%, 100%) with automated rollback on metric degradation
**Performance SLAs**: Set explicit SLAs for model latency (p99 < 100ms) and throughput to prevent production issues
**Retraining Triggers**: Define automated retraining triggers (performance drop >5%, data drift detected, 90 days elapsed)
**Reproducibility**: Version control evaluation code, datasets, and model artifacts to enable reproducible evaluation
**Automated Evaluation**: Integrate evaluation into CI/CD pipelines to run on every model version automatically
**Human Evaluation**: Supplement automated metrics with human evaluation for subjective tasks (generation, summarization)
**Adversarial Testing**: Test model robustness with adversarial examples and input perturbations before deployment
**OOD Detection**: Monitor for out-of-distribution inputs and flag low-confidence predictions for human review
**Model Cards**: Document model evaluation results, limitations, and intended use cases in standardized model cards
**Continuous Monitoring**: Track model performance metrics in production dashboards with alerting on degradation
