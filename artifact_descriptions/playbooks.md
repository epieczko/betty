# Name: playbooks

## Executive Summary

Incident Response Playbooks are step-by-step operational procedures that guide SRE teams and on-call engineers through diagnosing, mitigating, and resolving production incidents. These executable runbooks reduce MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution) by providing prescriptive troubleshooting steps, decision trees, automated remediation scripts, and escalation criteria for common incident scenarios including service outages, performance degradations, security breaches, and infrastructure failures.

Aligned with ITIL 4 incident management principles and Google SRE best practices, these playbooks integrate with modern incident management platforms (PagerDuty Runbook Automation, Incident.io, FireHydrant) to enable both manual execution and automated remediation. Each playbook follows the incident command system (ICS) structure, defines clear roles (Incident Commander, Communications Lead, Technical Lead), and includes automated validation steps, rollback procedures, and post-incident documentation requirements.

### Strategic Importance

- **MTTR Reduction**: Standardized procedures reduce mean time to resolution by 40-60% compared to ad-hoc troubleshooting
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform incident response regardless of which on-call engineer responds
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Captures expert troubleshooting knowledge in executable, version-controlled format
- **Automation Enabler**: Provides foundation for PagerDuty Runbook Automation, Ansible playbooks, and auto-remediation
- **Training Accelerator**: Reduces onboarding time for new on-call engineers from months to weeks
- **Compliance**: Supports SOC 2, ISO 27001, and audit requirements for documented incident response procedures
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables post-mortem-driven refinement of response procedures based on actual incidents

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact provides executable, step-by-step procedures for responding to specific incident types, enabling rapid diagnosis, mitigation, and resolution. It solves the problem of inconsistent incident response by codifying expert troubleshooting knowledge into repeatable, testable playbooks that reduce MTTR and minimize human error during high-pressure incident scenarios.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Service outage playbooks (database down, API unavailable, cache failure, load balancer issues)
- Performance degradation playbooks (slow queries, memory leaks, CPU spikes, network latency)
- Security incident playbooks (DDoS attacks, unauthorized access, data breaches, malware detection)
- Infrastructure failure playbooks (EC2 instance failures, Kubernetes pod crashes, storage exhaustion)
- Automated remediation procedures (service restarts, cache clearing, scaling actions, traffic shifting)
- Decision trees for symptom-based troubleshooting
- Escalation criteria and handoff procedures to specialized teams
- Validation and smoke test procedures post-remediation
- Integration with PagerDuty Runbook Automation, Ansible, Python scripts, AWS Systems Manager
- Rollback procedures and safe-to-proceed checkpoints

**Out of Scope**:
- General on-call procedures (covered in on-call-handbook artifact)
- Post-incident analysis and RCA (covered in root-cause-analyses artifact)
- Long-term architectural improvements (covered in post-mortem action items)
- Standard deployment procedures (covered in deployment runbooks)
- Monitoring and alerting configuration (covered in observability documentation)

### Target Audience

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
