# Name: product-launch-plan

## Executive Summary

The Product Launch Plan is a comprehensive strategic and tactical blueprint that orchestrates the end-to-end product launch process, from beta program design through general availability (GA) and post-launch optimization. This artifact defines launch tiers, success metrics, GTM motions, customer onboarding strategies, feedback loops, and iteration plans that ensure successful market introduction and product adoption.

Integrating best practices from Product-Led Growth, traditional enterprise sales motions, and launch frameworks like Pragmatic Marketing's Launch methodology, this plan coordinates cross-functional activities across Product, Engineering, Marketing, Sales, and Customer Success. It defines beta/early access criteria, phased rollout strategies, feature flags, rollback plans, and success metrics (adoption, engagement, NPS, revenue). Product Managers and Product Marketing Managers use this artifact alongside tools like LaunchDarkly for feature management, Amplitude/Mixpanel for analytics, and project management platforms to execute high-impact launches.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
