# Name: asyncapi-specification

## Executive Summary

The AsyncAPI Specification defines asynchronous, event-driven, and message-based APIs in a machine-readable format. This specification documents message channels, operations (publish/subscribe), message schemas, protocol bindings, and server configurations for systems using Kafka, RabbitMQ, MQTT, WebSockets, AMQP, and other messaging protocols.

Built using AsyncAPI 2.x/3.x specification language (similar to OpenAPI for REST), AsyncAPI documents leverage JSON Schema or Avro for message payload definitions, protocol bindings for broker-specific configurations, and support features like message traits, operation traits, tags, external documentation, and reusable components. They enable code generation, documentation generation, validation tooling, and provide a contract-first approach to designing event-driven microservices, pub/sub architectures, and real-time communication systems.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Best Practices

**Specification Design**:

**Channel Design**:
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear channel names (user.created, order.shipped)
- **Namespacing**: Organize channels by domain (orders/created, orders/updated)
- **Avoid Ambiguity**: Make channel purpose obvious from name
- **Topic Hierarchies**: Use hierarchical topics for MQTT (sensors/temperature/living-room)

**Message Schema Design**:
- **JSON Schema**: Use JSON Schema for validation and documentation
- **Schema Evolution**: Design for backward compatibility (optional fields)
- **Reusable Schemas**: Define common schemas in components section
- **Content Type**: Always specify contentType (application/json, avro/binary)
- **Message Examples**: Provide examples for all messages

**Operations**:
- **Publish vs Subscribe**: Clearly distinguish publisher and subscriber operations
- **Operation IDs**: Assign unique operationId for code generation
- **Bidirectional**: Define both publish and subscribe when bidirectional

- **Parameters**: Define reusable channel parameters

**Security**:
- **Security Schemes**: Document all authentication mechanisms
- **Per-Server Security**: Specify security per server configuration
- **Protocol Security**: Document TLS, SASL, OAuth2 configurations
- **Credentials**: Never embed credentials in spec; use placeholders

**Documentation**:
- **Info Section**: Provide clear API title, description, version, contact
- **Descriptions**: Document all channels, operations, messages thoroughly
- **External Docs**: Link to additional documentation
- **Tags**: Use tags for grouping related operations
- **Examples**: Include message payload examples

**Message Headers**:
- **Standard Headers**: Define common headers (correlation ID, timestamp)
- **Correlation IDs**: Use for request-reply patterns
- **CloudEvents**: Consider CloudEvents spec for event metadata
- **Tracing**: Include trace context headers (W3C Trace Context)

**Error Handling**:

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
