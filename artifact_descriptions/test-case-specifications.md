# Name: test-case-specifications

## Executive Summary

The Test Case Specifications artifact documents detailed, structured test scenarios with preconditions, test steps, expected results, and acceptance criteria using formats such as Gherkin syntax (Given-When-Then), traditional step-by-step procedures, or tabular test case templates. Specifications employ test design techniques including equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, decision tables, state transition testing, and pairwise testing to ensure comprehensive coverage with optimized test case count.

As the foundational test design deliverable, this artifact serves QA engineers, manual testers, test automation engineers, business analysts, and developers who need unambiguous test scenarios for validation. Test cases map to requirements via traceability matrix, include priority/severity classifications (P0-Critical path, P1-High, P2-Medium, P3-Low), specify test data requirements, document environmental prerequisites, and integrate with test management platforms (TestRail, Zephyr, qTest, Azure Test Plans, Xray). Specifications target measurable coverage goals: 100% of critical user journeys, 80%+ requirements coverage, risk-based prioritization focusing on high-impact/high-probability defect areas.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
