# Name: content-strategy

## Executive Summary

Content Strategy is the systematic planning, creation, delivery, and governance of useful, usable content across the entire content lifecycle. This artifact applies frameworks from Kristina Halvorson's "Content Strategy for the Web," the Diátaxis documentation system, and Content Design London methodologies to solve the core problem of content chaos—duplicated, outdated, inconsistent, or trivial content that frustrates users and wastes organizational resources.

This strategic document defines what content exists, why it exists, how it's structured (information architecture), who creates and maintains it (governance), and how success is measured. Drawing on content auditing techniques, content modeling practices, editorial workflow design, and IA best practices from the Information Architecture Institute, it serves Content Strategists, UX Writers, Product Managers, and Marketing Leads who need to transform ad-hoc content creation into a scalable, user-centered content system that delivers the right content to the right user at the right time in the right format.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact establishes the strategic foundation for all content decisions—from information architecture and content modeling to editorial governance and measurement frameworks. It solves the "content sprawl" problem where organizations produce massive volumes of unmaintained, unfindable, or contradictory content, supporting data-driven decisions about what content to create, maintain, retire, and how to structure it for multi-channel delivery (web, mobile, voice, AR/VR).

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Content audit methodology and inventory (quantitative and qualitative analysis)
- Information architecture (IA) including taxonomy, ontology, metadata schema, and navigation design
- Content models and structured content specifications (COPE: Create Once, Publish Everywhere)
- Content governance framework (roles, workflows, approval processes, ownership model)
- Editorial calendar and content production workflows
- Voice, tone, and style guidelines integration
- Content lifecycle management (creation, review, publication, maintenance, archival, deletion)
- Multi-channel content strategy and adaptive content design
- Content performance measurement and KPIs
- Content technology stack requirements (CMS, DAM, PIM evaluation criteria)
- Content migration strategy and gap analysis

**Out of Scope**:
- Detailed UX copywriting and microcopy (covered by microcopy-guides and style guides)
- Technical CMS implementation and development (covered by technical architecture docs)
- SEO keyword research and optimization tactics (covered by SEO strategy)

## Best Practices

**Start with Content Audit**: Conduct comprehensive content inventory (quantitative) + content audit (qualitative) before strategizing; use tools like Screaming Frog, Content Analysis Tool, or custom scripts to catalog existing content
**User Research Foundation**: Base content strategy on actual user research—task analysis, search query analysis, customer support tickets, user interviews; avoid assumption-based content planning
**Content-First Design**: Develop content strategy before visual design; "lorem ipsum" delays content problems until it's expensive to fix; use realistic content in prototypes
**Define Core Model First**: Establish content models (content types, attributes, relationships) early; changing content structure after CMS implementation costs 10x more
**Structured Content Thinking**: Design content as structured chunks, not pages; enables COPE (Create Once, Publish Everywhere) across web, mobile, voice, email, print
**Governance Before Scale**: Establish clear ownership, workflows, and approval processes before ramping up content production; ungoverned content becomes legacy debt
**Measure What Matters**: Define content KPIs aligned with business objectives—task completion, time-to-answer, search success, conversion paths—not vanity metrics like page views
**Content Lifecycle Planning**: Every content piece needs creation, review, update, and retirement plans; orphaned content becomes misinformation and SEO liability
**Taxonomy Discipline**: Develop controlled vocabularies through card sorting and tree testing; organic tagging without governance creates noise, not findability
**Editorial Calendar Realism**: Plan content production capacity based on actual team velocity; chronic backlog indicates strategy-resource mismatch
**Mobile-First Content**: Design content for smallest screen first; content that works in 320px viewport works everywhere; desktop-first content fails on mobile
**Voice & Tone Consistency**: Document voice (personality) and tone (mood variations) with specific examples; integrate with content review checklist
**Accessibility from Start**: Write for 8th grade reading level (Hemingway Editor); use semantic structure; provide alt text strategy; test with screen readers
**ROT Identification**: During content audit, ruthlessly identify Redundant, Outdated, Trivial content; archive or delete rather than migrate technical debt
**Cross-Functional Workshops**: Run content strategy workshops with Product, Design, Engineering, Marketing, Legal, Support; siloed strategy fails in implementation
**Prototype with Real Content**: Test information architecture and navigation with actual representative content, not category labels; reveals structural problems early
**Version Control for Content**: Treat content as code; use Git for documentation, markdown for portability, structured formats for content source of truth
**CMS Evaluation Framework**: Assess content platforms against content model requirements, not feature checklists; CMS should serve strategy, not dictate it
**Content Debt Management**: Track and prioritize content technical debt (outdated, broken, inconsistent) like engineering manages code debt; allocate capacity for remediation
**Continuous Content Operations**: Establish ongoing content maintenance cycles, not one-time projects; 80% of content value comes from 20% that's actively maintained

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
