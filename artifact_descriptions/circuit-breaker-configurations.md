# Name: circuit-breaker-configurations

## Executive Summary

The Circuit Breaker Configurations document defines the resilience and fault tolerance settings for all service-to-service integrations, third-party API calls, and external system dependencies using circuit breaker pattern implementations (Hystrix, Resilience4j, Polly, Envoy, Istio). This artifact specifies failure thresholds, timeout durations, half-open state retry logic, fallback strategies, and monitoring configurations to prevent cascading failures and protect system stability during partial outages.

As a critical component of distributed system resilience, these configurations implement the circuit breaker pattern by automatically detecting failures (error rates, timeouts, exceptions), opening circuits to fail fast, allowing time for recovery in half-open state, and closing circuits when health is restored. The document covers implementation across service mesh (Istio circuit breaking, Envoy outlier detection), API gateways (Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway), and application-level libraries (Resilience4j for Java, Polly for .NET, resilience for Node.js), with specific thresholds for each dependency based on SLO commitments and failure domain analysis.

### Strategic Importance

- **Cascading Failure Prevention**: Stops failure propagation by failing fast when dependencies are unavailable
- **System Stability**: Protects healthy services from being overwhelmed by requests to failing dependencies
- **Fast Failure Detection**: Reduces mean time to detection (MTTD) through automated failure thresholds
- **Graceful Degradation**: Enables fallback behaviors maintaining partial functionality during outages
- **Resource Protection**: Prevents thread pool exhaustion and connection pool depletion
- **Recovery Automation**: Automatically probes failing dependencies and restores traffic when healthy
- **Operational Resilience**: Reduces incident severity and manual intervention during dependency failures

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This document establishes the circuit breaker configurations for all service dependencies to prevent cascading failures, enable fast failure detection, and automate recovery during partial system outages. It solves the problem of how to fail gracefully when dependencies are unavailable by defining thresholds, timeouts, and fallback strategies that balance availability, latency, and user experience across different failure scenarios.

## Best Practices

**Per-Dependency Configuration**: Configure circuit breaker settings independently for each external dependency
**SLO-Driven Thresholds**: Derive failure thresholds from error budgets and SLO commitments (e.g., 99.9% SLO → 0.1% error threshold)
**Volume Threshold**: Set minimum request volume (e.g., 20 requests) before circuit evaluation to avoid false positives
**Fast Failure**: Configure open state to fail immediately without attempting calls (fail-fast principle)
**Half-Open Testing**: Use small number of test requests (3-5) in half-open state to probe recovery
**Graduated Recovery**: Close circuit only after consecutive successful test requests in half-open state
**Timeout Integration**: Set circuit breaker timeout slightly higher than request timeout to catch timeout failures
**Fallback Strategy**: Always define fallback behavior - never return raw errors to end users
**Monitoring Integration**: Export circuit breaker metrics (state, failures, fallbacks) to Prometheus/CloudWatch
**Alert on Open State**: Configure alerts when circuits open, indicating dependency issues
**Dashboard Visibility**: Create Grafana/Datadog dashboards showing circuit states across all dependencies
**Environment-Specific Tuning**: Use more conservative thresholds in production than in dev/staging
**Bulkhead Isolation**: Combine circuit breaker with bulkhead pattern (separate thread pools per dependency)
**Exponential Backoff**: Configure sleep window to increase exponentially in open state (30s, 60s, 120s)
**Exception Classification**: Define which exceptions trigger circuit (5xx, timeouts) vs. which don't (4xx client errors)
**Testing in Chaos**: Regularly test circuit breakers using chaos engineering (Chaos Monkey, fault injection)
**Slow Call Detection**: Configure threshold for slow calls (e.g., >5s) to trigger circuit independent of errors
**Service Mesh Integration**: Prefer service mesh circuit breaking (Istio, Linkerd) for infrastructure-level resilience
**Configuration as Code**: Store all circuit breaker configs in Git with version control and code review
**Dynamic Tuning**: Monitor circuit breaker behavior in production and tune thresholds based on real failure patterns
