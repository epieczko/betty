# Name: vulnerability-management-plan

## Executive Summary

The Vulnerability Management Plan establishes a continuous, risk-based process for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, remediating, and tracking security vulnerabilities across the organization's attack surface. Following NIST SP 800-40 and industry best practices, this plan defines vulnerability scanning cadence, CVSS-based prioritization, patch management SLAs, and exception handling to systematically reduce organizational risk and maintain compliance with security frameworks.

As the operational framework for proactive security risk reduction, this plan provides security teams with scanning schedules and tooling requirements, IT operations with patch deployment timelines, development teams with secure coding and dependency management guidance, and executive leadership with metrics on vulnerability exposure and remediation effectiveness. It transforms reactive patching into a disciplined, measurable security practice.

### Strategic Importance

- **Attack Surface Reduction**: Systematically identifies and remediates vulnerabilities before exploitation
- **Breach Prevention**: Reduces risk of compromise through timely patching of critical/high vulnerabilities
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets vulnerability management requirements for PCI-DSS, SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST CSF
- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Uses CVSS scores, exploitability, and business context to prioritize remediation
- **SLA-Driven Remediation**: Defines clear timelines (Critical: 7 days, High: 30 days, Medium: 90 days)
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Enables ongoing vulnerability assessment vs. point-in-time snapshots
- **Metrics & Accountability**: Tracks mean time to remediate (MTTR), vulnerability aging, and remediation rates

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

The Vulnerability Management Plan defines the end-to-end process for continuously identifying, assessing, prioritizing, remediating, and verifying security vulnerabilities across infrastructure, applications, containers, and cloud environments. It establishes scanning frequency, CVSS-based risk scoring, remediation SLAs, exception processes, and metrics to ensure systematic vulnerability reduction.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Vulnerability identification: Scanning tools (Tenable, Qualys, Rapid7, Trivy, Snyk), scanning cadence, asset inventory
- Assessment & scoring: CVSS 3.1 scoring, EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System), CISA KEV catalog
- Prioritization framework: Risk-based ranking considering CVSS, exploitability, asset criticality, data sensitivity
- Remediation SLAs: Critical (7 days), High (30 days), Medium (90 days), Low (180 days)
- Patch management: OS patching, application updates, library/dependency updates, firmware updates
- Compensating controls: WAF rules, network segmentation, IDS/IPS signatures when patching delayed
- Exception handling: Risk acceptance process, temporary exceptions, compensating control requirements
- Verification: Re-scanning, penetration testing validation, attestation
- Metrics & reporting: MTTR, vulnerability aging, SLA compliance, trend analysis
- Tool stack: Vulnerability scanners, SCA tools, SAST/DAST, container scanning, cloud security posture management

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
