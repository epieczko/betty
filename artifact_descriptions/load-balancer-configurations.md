# Name: load-balancer-configurations

## Executive Summary

The Load Balancer Configurations artifact defines traffic distribution and high availability strategies for web applications, APIs, and microservices using cloud-native and self-hosted load balancing solutions. This artifact specifies Layer 4 (transport) and Layer 7 (application) load balancing configurations across AWS Elastic Load Balancers (ALB, NLB, CLB), Azure Load Balancer, Google Cloud Load Balancing, and open-source solutions (NGINX, HAProxy, Traefik, Envoy, Istio) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend targets, eliminate single points of failure, enable zero-downtime deployments through blue-green and canary patterns, and improve application performance through intelligent request routing.

As a critical component of cloud infrastructure resilience and scalability, this artifact serves Cloud Platform Engineers implementing highly available architectures, DevOps Engineers automating deployment strategies, Site Reliability Engineers ensuring service availability and performance, Network Engineers managing traffic flow, and Application Architects designing distributed systems. It addresses essential load balancing patterns including health check configurations, session persistence (sticky sessions), SSL/TLS termination, WebSocket support, connection draining, cross-zone load balancing, and integration with service discovery mechanisms.

## Best Practices

**Version Control**: Store load balancer configurations as infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CloudFormation) in Git
**Layer 7 for HTTP**: Use Application Load Balancers (ALB) or NGINX for HTTP/HTTPS traffic to enable path-based routing and SSL termination
**Layer 4 for TCP/UDP**: Use Network Load Balancers (NLB) for ultra-low latency, high throughput, and static IP requirements
**Multi-AZ Deployment**: Enable cross-zone load balancing for high availability across multiple availability zones
**Health Check Configuration**: Configure aggressive health checks (5-10 second intervals) with appropriate thresholds (2 healthy, 2 unhealthy)
**Connection Draining**: Set deregistration delay (30-300 seconds) to allow in-flight requests to complete during deployments
**SSL/TLS Termination**: Terminate SSL at load balancer to reduce backend compute overhead, enforce TLS 1.2+ only
**Certificate Management**: Use AWS ACM, Let's Encrypt, or cert-manager for automated certificate provisioning and renewal
**Session Persistence**: Use application-managed sessions (Redis/Memcached) instead of load balancer sticky sessions when possible
**Idle Timeout**: Configure appropriate idle timeouts (60-300 seconds) based on application keep-alive requirements
**WebSocket Support**: Enable WebSocket support on ALB or use NLB for WebSocket connections
**Access Logging**: Enable access logs to S3 or CloudWatch for audit trail, troubleshooting, and analytics
**Request Routing**: Use path-based routing (/api/* → backend, /static/* → CDN origin) and host-based routing for multi-tenant apps
**Target Group Health**: Monitor target health continuously, automatically remove unhealthy targets from rotation
**Blue-Green Deployments**: Use weighted target groups to gradually shift traffic from old to new deployment (90/10 → 50/50 → 0/100)
**Canary Testing**: Route small percentage (5-10%) of traffic to new version for validation before full rollout
**Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting at load balancer layer to prevent abuse and protect backends
**DDoS Protection**: Enable AWS Shield, Cloudflare, or cloud-native DDoS protection for public-facing load balancers
**Security Groups**: Apply restrictive security groups allowing only required traffic (HTTP/HTTPS from internet, backend ports from ALB only)
**Cross-Region Failover**: Implement Route 53 health checks and failover routing for multi-region disaster recovery
**Prometheus Metrics**: Export metrics from NGINX/HAProxy to Prometheus for alerting and dashboards
**Cost Optimization**: Use NLB instead of ALB when Layer 7 features not required (save 25% on LB costs)
**Regular Updates**: Review and update load balancer configurations quarterly or when architecture changes
**Retention Compliance**: Follow organizational retention policies for how long to maintain and when to archive/destroy

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
