# Name: decommissioning-plan

## Executive Summary

The Decommissioning Plan is a comprehensive operational artifact that defines procedures, timelines, and responsibilities for safely retiring systems, applications, and infrastructure while preserving data integrity, maintaining compliance, and minimizing business disruption. This plan establishes structured sunset processes that ensure dependent systems are migrated, data is properly archived, access is revoked, and resources are reclaimed in accordance with regulatory retention requirements and security best practices.

As a foundational lifecycle management deliverable, it orchestrates dependency analysis, user migration, data archival, access deprovisioning, infrastructure teardown, and license reclamation. The plan mitigates decommissioning risks through stakeholder communication, rollback procedures, compliance verification, and post-decommissioning validation that confirms all dependencies are satisfied and no business processes are disrupted.

### Strategic Importance

- **Cost Reduction**: Eliminates unnecessary infrastructure, licensing, and maintenance costs for unused systems
- **Security Risk Mitigation**: Removes attack surface by deprovisioning unused systems and revoking stale access
- **Compliance Assurance**: Ensures data retention, archival, and disposal meet regulatory requirements
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Simplifies architecture by removing legacy systems and reducing operational complexity
- **Resource Reclamation**: Frees infrastructure capacity, licenses, and engineering resources for higher-value work

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
