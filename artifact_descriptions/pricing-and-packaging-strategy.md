# Name: pricing-and-packaging-strategy

## Executive Summary

The Pricing and Packaging Strategy defines the comprehensive approach to monetizing products and services through value metrics, pricing models, tier structures, and go-to-market packaging. This strategic artifact establishes how the organization captures value from customers by determining pricing methodologies (value-based, cost-plus, competitive), packaging frameworks (good/better/best, freemium, usage-based), and pricing tactics to drive revenue growth, customer acquisition, and margin expansion.

As a critical revenue strategy component, this artifact guides decisions on per-seat pricing vs usage-based pricing, freemium vs paid-only models, land-and-expand strategies, bundling approaches, and feature/value differentiation across tiers. It incorporates pricing research (Van Westendorp, conjoint analysis), competitive positioning, customer segmentation, and financial modeling to optimize customer lifetime value (LTV), reduce customer acquisition cost (CAC), improve LTV:CAC ratios, and maximize revenue per customer while maintaining competitive win rates.

### Strategic Importance

- **Revenue Growth**: Optimizes pricing to maximize revenue potential through value capture, upsell pathways, and expansion revenue
- **Market Positioning**: Establishes competitive positioning (premium, mid-market, value) through pricing levels and packaging
- **Customer Segmentation**: Addresses diverse customer segments with differentiated packaging (SMB, mid-market, enterprise)
- **Sales Efficiency**: Improves sales velocity through clear packaging, simplified SKUs, and transparent pricing
- **Margin Optimization**: Balances volume growth with margin targets through strategic price points and packaging
- **Competitive Response**: Positions offering competitively while maintaining sustainable margins and value perception
- **Monetization Innovation**: Enables new monetization models (consumption-based, outcome-based, hybrid) aligned with customer preferences

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This strategy defines the comprehensive monetization approach including:
- **Value Metrics**: Determining what to charge for (users, usage, outcomes, features, transactions, API calls)

- **Pricing Models**: Selecting freemium, per-seat, usage-based, tiered, hybrid, or outcome-based models
- **Land-and-Expand**: Structuring entry price points and upsell pathways to maximize customer lifetime value
- **Competitive Positioning**: Setting price points relative to competitors (premium +20%, at-market, value -20%)
- **Bundling Strategy**: Determining what to bundle vs sell separately (suites vs a-la-carte)
- **Discount Philosophy**: Establishing baseline for standard discounts, volume discounts, and negotiation room
- **Pricing Research**: Conducting willingness-to-pay research, price sensitivity analysis, and conjoint studies

## Best Practices

**Version Control**: Store in centralized version control system (Git, SharePoint with versioning, etc.) to maintain complete history and enable rollback
**Naming Conventions**: Follow organization's document naming standards for consistency and discoverability
**Template Usage**: Use approved templates to ensure completeness and consistency across teams
**Peer Review**: Have at least one qualified peer review before submitting for approval
**Metadata Completion**: Fully complete all metadata fields to enable search, classification, and lifecycle management
**Stakeholder Validation**: Review draft with key stakeholders before finalizing to ensure alignment and buy-in
**Plain Language**: Write in clear, concise language appropriate for the intended audience; avoid unnecessary jargon
**Visual Communication**: Include diagrams, charts, and tables to communicate complex information more effectively
**Traceability**: Reference source materials, related documents, and dependencies to provide context and enable navigation
**Regular Updates**: Review and update on scheduled cadence or when triggered by significant changes
**Approval Evidence**: Maintain clear record of who approved, when, and any conditions or caveats
**Distribution Management**: Clearly communicate where artifact is published and notify stakeholders of updates
**Retention Compliance**: Follow organizational retention policies for how long to maintain and when to archive/destroy

**Pricing & Packaging Strategy Best Practices**:
**Customer-Value Focus**: Price based on value delivered to customer, not internal costs; quantify ROI customers achieve
**Pricing Research**: Conduct Van Westendorp or conjoint analysis with 200+ customers/prospects before major pricing changes
**Segment Appropriately**: Create distinct packages for SMB, mid-market, and enterprise with appropriate pricing spread (3-5x)
**Simplify Tiers**: Limit to 3-4 pricing tiers (good/better/best); more tiers create confusion and decision paralysis
**Clear Differentiation**: Ensure each tier has obvious value differentiators; avoid marginal differences that confuse buyers
**Anchor Pricing**: Use highest tier to anchor value perception; middle tier becomes attractive compromise
**Charm Pricing**: Consider psychological pricing ($99 vs $100); test impact on conversion and perception
**Annual Incentive**: Discount annual pricing 15-20% vs monthly to improve cash flow and reduce churn
**Freemium Strategy**: If offering freemium, ensure free tier drives activation but requires upgrade for sustained value
**Usage Limits**: Set usage limits that ~40% of free users hit to drive conversion without excessive friction
**Land-and-Expand**: Design entry tier for low friction adoption; build clear upsell path as usage/value grows
**Bundling Discipline**: Bundle features that deliver combined value; avoid bundling to hide weak products
**Competitive Positioning**: Monitor competitive pricing monthly; maintain intentional positioning (at-market, premium, or value)
**Test and Learn**: Run A/B tests on pricing and packaging with new customers; measure impact on conversion and LTV
**Grandfather Carefully**: Limit grandfathering of old pricing; provide migration path to new pricing within 12 months
**Revenue Impact Model**: Model revenue impact of pricing changes across existing base and new business
**Sales Compensation**: Align sales comp with new pricing; avoid incentivizing undesired discounting behavior
**Customer Communication**: Announce packaging changes 60-90 days in advance with clear customer benefit framing
**Pricing Integrity**: Enforce pricing strategy through CPQ; limit exceptions requiring VP approval
