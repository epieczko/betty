# Name: dr-test-reports

## Executive Summary

Disaster Recovery (DR) Test Reports document the execution, results, and findings from disaster recovery tests including failover exercises, backup restoration, and RTO/RPO validation. These reports are critical for proving DR capability, identifying gaps, meeting compliance requirements (ISO 22301, SOC 2, NIST SP 800-34), and continuously improving recovery procedures.

DR test reports provide evidence that disaster recovery procedures work as designed, document actual RTO/RPO achieved versus targets, identify failures and improvement areas, and track remediation progress. They serve as audit evidence for regulatory compliance, inform stakeholders of DR readiness, and guide investment decisions in DR infrastructure and automation.

### Strategic Importance

- **Compliance Evidence**: Provides audit trail for ISO 22301, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, and regulatory DR testing requirements
- **RTO/RPO Validation**: Measures actual recovery time and data loss against defined objectives to identify gaps
- **Risk Identification**: Discovers weaknesses in DR procedures, automation, and infrastructure before real disasters
- **Continuous Improvement**: Documents lessons learned and tracks remediation to strengthen DR capabilities
- **Stakeholder Confidence**: Demonstrates to executives, customers, and auditors that DR plans are tested and viable
- **Investment Justification**: Provides data to justify DR infrastructure, automation, and process improvements
- **Team Preparedness**: Validates that teams can execute DR procedures under pressure and identifies training needs

   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
