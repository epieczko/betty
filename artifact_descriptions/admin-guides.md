# Name: admin-guides

## Executive Summary

Admin Guides provide comprehensive system administration documentation for managing production systems, user accounts, security configurations, backup/recovery procedures, and monitoring infrastructure. Created using modern documentation platforms like Docusaurus, MkDocs, or GitBook, admin guides follow the Diátaxis Framework methodology to deliver procedural, task-oriented content that system administrators and DevOps engineers rely on daily.

These guides implement docs-as-code principles, storing documentation in Git alongside infrastructure-as-code, enabling versioned releases using semantic versioning, and automating validation through CI/CD pipelines with tools like Vale and markdownlint. Written in Markdown or reStructuredText and following the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide, admin guides maintain consistency, searchability through Algolia DocSearch or Elasticsearch, and accessibility compliance per WCAG 2.1 standards.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

Admin Guides serve as authoritative procedural documentation for system administrators to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot production systems. They solve the problem of inconsistent system administration practices by providing step-by-step procedures, configuration templates, and troubleshooting guides that reduce mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) and minimize configuration drift.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- System administration procedures (user management, permissions, role-based access control)
- Configuration management (system settings, environment variables, service configuration)
- Backup and restore procedures (automated backups, disaster recovery, point-in-time recovery)
- Monitoring and alerting setup (metrics collection, dashboard configuration, alert thresholds)
- Security hardening procedures (CIS Benchmarks, security patches, vulnerability remediation)
- Maintenance windows and upgrade procedures
- Log management and audit trail configuration
- Performance tuning and capacity planning
- High availability and failover configuration

**Out of Scope**:
- Application-specific documentation (covered in developer handbooks)
- End-user procedures (covered in user guides)
- API documentation (covered in API reference guides)
- Architectural decisions and design rationale (covered in architecture documentation)
- Source code and development workflows (covered in developer handbook)

### Target Audience

**Primary Audience**:
- System Administrators who configure and maintain production systems
- DevOps Engineers who automate infrastructure and deployment pipelines
- Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) who ensure system availability and performance
- Platform Engineers who manage shared infrastructure platforms

**Secondary Audience**:
- Technical Writers and Documentation Engineers who maintain admin documentation
- Security Engineers who validate compliance with security procedures
- Support Engineers who troubleshoot production issues
- IT Managers who oversee system administration operations

## Best Practices

**Docs-as-Code Implementation**: Store documentation source in Git repositories alongside infrastructure code, enable branch-based workflows with pull requests, automate builds and deployments through CI/CD pipelines, and version documentation in sync with system releases

**Task-Oriented Structure**: Organize admin guides by administrative tasks (user management, backup/restore, monitoring setup) rather than system components, following Diátaxis how-to guide format with clear goal statements, prerequisites, step-by-step procedures, verification steps, and troubleshooting guidance

**Procedural Writing Standards**: Begin procedures with action verbs, use numbered lists for sequential steps, include expected outcomes after each step, provide command examples with actual syntax, explain parameters and options, include screenshots or terminal output examples, and add warnings/cautions before potentially destructive operations

**Configuration Examples**: Provide complete, working configuration file examples with inline comments explaining each setting, use syntax highlighting appropriate to file type, include environment-specific variations (dev, staging, production), and maintain example configurations as testable code

**Validation & Quality Assurance**: Implement automated testing of documentation with Vale for style consistency, markdownlint for Markdown formatting, spell checkers for typos, link checkers for broken references, and code snippet validators to ensure command examples remain current

**Search Optimization**: Structure content with descriptive headings, include searchable keywords and terminology, implement site search (Algolia DocSearch), create comprehensive navigation, provide breadcrumbs, maintain glossary of technical terms, and optimize for common troubleshooting queries

**Version Management**: Maintain documentation for all supported system versions, clearly label version-specific procedures, provide migration guides between versions, archive deprecated content with warnings, and implement version selector UI component

**Security-First Documentation**: Never include credentials or secrets in documentation examples, use placeholder values (e.g., YOUR_API_KEY), document least-privilege access patterns, include security hardening procedures, reference CIS Benchmarks and security frameworks, and maintain separate secure documentation for sensitive procedures

**Consistency & Style**: Follow Google Developer Documentation Style Guide for terminology and tone, maintain consistent terminology across all admin guides, use style guide enforcement tools (Vale), establish documentation review process with subject matter experts, and maintain approved terminology list

**Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance, provide alt text for all images and diagrams, maintain color contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1), support keyboard navigation, test with screen readers, use semantic HTML structure, and write in plain language (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 8-10)

**Continuous Updates**: Review documentation quarterly or after system changes, monitor support tickets to identify documentation gaps, track documentation feedback and improvement requests, update examples when APIs or commands change, and maintain changelog of documentation updates

**Cross-Referencing**: Link related procedures (e.g., link backup procedures from disaster recovery guide), reference prerequisite setup steps, connect to troubleshooting guides, link to API documentation when relevant, and maintain bidirectional links between related content

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
