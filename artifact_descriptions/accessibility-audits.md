# Name: accessibility-audits

## Executive Summary

The Accessibility Audits artifact documents comprehensive evaluations of digital products and services against accessibility standards including WCAG 2.1/2.2 (Levels A, AA, AAA), Section 508, EN 301 549, and ADA compliance requirements. This artifact provides structured findings from manual and automated testing using tools such as axe DevTools, WAVE, Lighthouse, JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and keyboard navigation assessments.

As a critical quality assurance deliverable, this artifact serves accessibility specialists, QA engineers, development teams, product managers, and compliance officers who need detailed technical findings to remediate barriers and ensure inclusive digital experiences. It combines automated scan results (covering 30-40% of accessibility issues) with expert manual testing (required for 60-70% of WCAG criteria), keyboard navigation testing, screen reader compatibility validation, and color contrast analysis. Typical audits evaluate compliance across multiple criteria: perceivable (text alternatives, time-based media, adaptable content, distinguishable), operable (keyboard accessible, sufficient time, seizures prevention, navigable), understandable (readable, predictable, input assistance), and robust (compatible with assistive technologies).

### Strategic Importance

- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact serves as the authoritative record of accessibility conformance testing results, identifying WCAG 2.1/2.2 violations, ARIA implementation issues, keyboard navigation barriers, screen reader compatibility problems, and color contrast deficiencies. It provides prioritized remediation recommendations with severity ratings (Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on impact to users with disabilities and legal/compliance risk.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
