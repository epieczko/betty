# Name: multi-region-active-active-plan

## Executive Summary

The Multi-Region Active-Active Plan is a strategic infrastructure artifact that defines globally distributed architectures where multiple regions simultaneously serve production traffic, providing maximum availability, disaster resilience, and optimal user experience through geographic proximity. This plan establishes active-active patterns for compute, data, and traffic distribution across geographic regions, ensuring near-zero Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and continuous service availability during regional failures.

As a foundational high-availability deliverable, it defines multi-region deployment strategies, global load balancing and traffic routing, cross-region data replication and consistency models, and regional failover procedures. The plan addresses complex distributed system challenges including data consistency (eventual vs. strong), conflict resolution, latency optimization, and compliance with data residency regulations across geographic boundaries.

### Strategic Importance

- **Maximum Availability**: Achieves 99.99%+ uptime through geographic redundancy with no single point of failure
- **Disaster Resilience**: Survives complete regional failures with automatic traffic failover and zero data loss
- **Global Performance**: Reduces user latency by serving requests from geographically proximate regions
- **Business Continuity**: Enables continuous operations during regional outages, natural disasters, or maintenance
- **Compliance Enablement**: Supports data residency and sovereignty requirements across jurisdictions

## Purpose & Scope

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
