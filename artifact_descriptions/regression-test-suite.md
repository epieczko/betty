# Name: regression-test-suite

## Executive Summary

The Regression Test Suite artifact comprises curated test cases and automated test scripts executed after code changes to validate that existing functionality remains unaffected by new features, bug fixes, or refactoring. The suite implements test selection strategies including smoke tests (critical path validation in <15 minutes), sanity tests (quick verification of specific functionality), full regression suite (comprehensive validation), and risk-based regression selection using test impact analysis (identifying tests affected by code changes).

As a critical quality safeguard, this artifact serves QA engineers, test automation engineers, developers, release managers, and DevOps engineers who need efficient regression validation integrated into CI/CD pipelines. The regression suite employs intelligent test selection (running only tests impacted by changes), test prioritization (executing high-risk/high-value tests first), parallel test execution (reducing execution time via Selenium Grid, Docker containers, cloud-based testing platforms), flaky test quarantine (isolating unreliable tests), and comprehensive test coverage across functional areas. Target metrics include execution time (<30 minutes for smoke tests, <2 hours for full suite), pass rate (>95% baseline), test stability (flaky test rate <2%), and defect detection rate (catching 90%+ of regression defects before production).

### Strategic Importance

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
