# Name: steering-committee-minutes

## Executive Summary

Steering Committee Minutes capture high-level governance decisions, portfolio investment approvals, strategic direction, and escalation resolutions from executive oversight bodies. These minutes document the committee's application of portfolio governance frameworks (SAFe Lean Portfolio Management, Portfolio Kanban, stage-gate processes) and decision methodologies (DACI, RAPID) to guide strategic initiatives and manage organizational investment portfolios.

Modern steering committee governance leverages strategic planning tools (ProductPlan, Aha!, Jira Align) and collaboration platforms (Confluence, Miro) to track portfolio health, investment decisions, strategic alignment, and risk escalations. The minutes serve as the authoritative record of executive decisions on program approval, funding allocation, strategic pivots, and issue escalation. They provide transparency to program managers, executive leadership, and portfolio management on governance decisions and their rationale.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

Steering Committee Minutes provide the official record of executive governance decisions including portfolio investment approvals, strategic direction changes, resource allocation, escalation resolutions, and program oversight. The minutes answer: What did the committee decide? What investments were approved? What escalations were resolved? What strategic guidance was provided? They create accountability and transparency for executive-level portfolio governance.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
