# Name: data-product-specification

## Executive Summary

A Data Product Specification is a comprehensive design document that defines a data product as a self-contained, discoverable, addressable, trustworthy, and interoperable data asset with clear ownership, SLOs/SLAs, and consumer interfaces—treating data as a product rather than a byproduct. This artifact embodies Data Mesh principles (domain ownership, data as a product, self-serve data platform, federated computational governance) and applies product management thinking to data asset creation and delivery.

Data Product Specifications document the product vision, consumer use cases, data schemas, quality SLOs, access interfaces (APIs, SQL endpoints, event streams), observability metrics, and operational ownership using frameworks like the Data Product Canvas (Zhamak Dehghani), Data Product Quantum model, and DAMA DMBoK data product lifecycle management. Implementation platforms include dbt, Databricks Unity Catalog data sharing, Snowflake Data Marketplace, AWS Data Exchange, Google Analytics Hub, and dedicated data product platforms (Starburst, Dremio) aligned with modern data architecture patterns.

### Strategic Importance

- **Product Thinking for Data**: Shifts mindset from technical data delivery to consumer-centric product development with defined value proposition
- **Domain Ownership**: Enables decentralized data ownership where domain teams own their data products end-to-end
- **Self-Service Analytics**: Provides well-documented, quality-assured data products that analytics teams can consume independently
- **Data Monetization**: Creates foundation for internal data marketplace and external data product commercialization
- **Interoperability**: Defines standard interfaces and contracts enabling data products to compose into larger data solutions
- **Trust & Quality**: Establishes SLOs for freshness, accuracy, completeness that build consumer confidence in data products
- **Scalable Governance**: Implements federated computational governance through embedded quality, security, and compliance capabilities

## Best Practices

**Data Product Canvas**: Use the Data Product Canvas framework to structure product vision, value proposition, and consumer needs
**Consumer-First Design**: Start with consumer use cases and work backward to define data schema and transformations
**Quantum Architecture**: Apply Data Product Quantum model ensuring code, data, metadata, and infrastructure are packaged together
**API-First Interfaces**: Design RESTful APIs or GraphQL endpoints as primary consumption layer using OpenAPI/GraphQL schema specifications
**Semantic Layer**: Implement business logic and metrics in a semantic layer (dbt metrics, Looker LookML, Cube.js) rather than in consumer code
**SLO-Driven Development**: Define measurable SLOs for freshness, quality, and performance before building the data product
**Embedded Quality**: Integrate Great Expectations, dbt tests, or Soda Core checks directly in data product pipelines
**Automated Documentation**: Generate API documentation (Swagger UI, GraphQL Playground) and data dictionaries automatically from code
**Versioning Strategy**: Implement semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) with backward compatibility guarantees for MINOR/PATCH updates
**Observability Built-In**: Instrument data products with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus metrics, and structured logging from day one
**Data Contracts**: Define explicit data contracts (JSON Schema, Avro, Protobuf) that specify guarantees to consumers
**Self-Service Onboarding**: Provide quickstart guides, sample queries, Jupyter notebooks, and sandbox environments for consumer onboarding
**Cost Transparency**: Expose compute and storage costs to consumers, enabling informed decisions about usage optimization
**Incremental Delivery**: Launch with MVP data product and iterate based on consumer feedback and usage analytics
**Federated Governance**: Embed governance policies (access control, data masking, retention) computationally in data product infrastructure
**Marketplace Integration**: Publish data products to internal data marketplace (Collibra, Alation) or external marketplaces (Snowflake, AWS Data Exchange)
**dbt Package Design**: Structure dbt projects as reusable packages with clear dependencies, documentation, and semantic versioning
**Ownership Clarity**: Assign named product owner with clear responsibility for roadmap, quality, and consumer satisfaction

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
