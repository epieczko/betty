# Name: customer-onboarding-plan

## Executive Summary

The Customer Onboarding Plan defines the comprehensive strategy, touchpoints, resources, and success metrics for transitioning new customers from signed contract to active product adoption and value realization. This strategic planning artifact orchestrates cross-functional activities spanning Sales handoff, implementation, training, integration, and success criteria validation across 30-90 day onboarding journeys depending on product complexity.

Modern B2B SaaS onboarding programs achieve 85-95% customer activation rates (first meaningful action within 7 days), 70-80% feature adoption rates by day 30, and 25-40% reduction in time-to-value compared to ad-hoc approaches. Organizations with structured onboarding plans experience 10-15% higher net revenue retention (NRR), 30-50% lower early churn rates, and 2-3x faster expansion revenue from upsells and cross-sells.

Effective onboarding plans coordinate Customer Success Managers, Implementation Engineers, Support teams, Product teams, and Sales stakeholders around shared milestones, health scores, and intervention triggers. The plan balances high-touch white-glove service for enterprise customers ($100K+ ACV) with tech-touch automation and self-service resources for SMB segments, optimizing cost-to-serve while maintaining quality outcomes across customer segments.

### Strategic Importance

- **Revenue Protection**: Prevents customer churn in critical 90-day period when 40-60% of annual churn risk materializes
- **Time-to-Value Acceleration**: Reduces time from contract signature to measurable business outcomes by 30-50% vs unstructured approaches
- **Expansion Revenue**: Establishes foundation for upsells/cross-sells, with well-onboarded customers showing 2-3x higher expansion rates
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: Improves LTV by 15-25% through higher retention, faster adoption, and increased product engagement
- **Operational Efficiency**: Standardizes onboarding processes, reducing cost-per-onboarding by 20-35% through automation and playbooks
- **Product Feedback Loop**: Captures early-stage customer insights driving product roadmap and UX improvements
- **Advocacy Development**: Creates promoter customers (NPS 9-10) who provide referrals, case studies, and reviews

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact serves as the authoritative blueprint for customer onboarding orchestration, defining the end-to-end journey from contract signature through successful product adoption and business outcome achievement. It solves the coordination challenge across Sales, Customer Success, Implementation, Support, and Product teams by establishing shared timelines, responsibilities, milestones, and success criteria. The plan enables resource allocation decisions, identifies automation opportunities, defines customer segmentation strategies (enterprise vs SMB onboarding tracks), and provides the measurement framework for onboarding effectiveness, time-to-value, and early-stage customer health.

### Scope

- Implementation and configuration activities including data migration, integrations, SSO setup, and environment provisioning
- Training and enablement programs covering admin training, end-user enablement, certification programs, and office hours
- Success criteria definition including activation metrics, feature adoption KPIs, business outcome validation, and health scoring

- Risk identification and intervention triggers including low engagement alerts, stuck implementation flags, and churn risk indicators
- Upsell and expansion pathway identification during onboarding including feature discovery, use case expansion, and user growth
- Technology stack requirements including onboarding automation platforms (Totango, Gainsight, ChurnZero), LMS systems, and analytics
- Metrics and KPIs including time-to-first-value, activation rate, feature adoption %, NPS scores, and onboarding completion rate
