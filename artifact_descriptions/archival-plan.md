# Name: archival-plan

## Executive Summary

The Archival Plan is a critical compliance and data governance artifact that defines the systematic approach for archiving, preserving, and managing records throughout their lifecycle in accordance with regulatory requirements and business needs. Organizations using GRC platforms like Vanta, Drata, or Secureframe can achieve 40-60% efficiency gains in archival operations through automated policy enforcement and evidence retention workflows.

This strategic document establishes retention schedules, archival procedures, storage methodologies, and disposition protocols that ensure compliance with SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR Article 5(1)(e) (storage limitation), PCI-DSS Requirement 3.1, HIPAA 45 CFR § 164.316, and SOX Section 802. The plan serves as the authoritative reference for legal holds, e-discovery requests, audit evidence preservation, and secure data destruction—reducing legal risk while optimizing storage costs by 30-50% through intelligent tiering and lifecycle automation.

### Strategic Importance

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures adherence to retention requirements across SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, and industry-specific regulations
- **Legal Risk Mitigation**: Provides defensible archival processes for litigation holds, e-discovery, and regulatory examinations
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduces storage costs 30-50% through automated tiering between hot, warm, cold, and glacier storage tiers
- **Audit Readiness**: Maintains comprehensive audit trails and evidence preservation with 99.9% retrieval SLAs
- **Data Governance Excellence**: Integrates with data classification, retention schedules, and privacy compliance programs

## Purpose & Scope

## Best Practices

**Document Management**:
- **Version Control**: Store in centralized version control system (Git, SharePoint with versioning, etc.) to maintain complete history and enable rollback
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow organization's document naming standards for consistency and discoverability
- **Template Usage**: Use approved templates to ensure completeness and consistency across teams
- **Peer Review**: Have at least one qualified peer review before submitting for approval
- **Metadata Completion**: Fully complete all metadata fields to enable search, classification, and lifecycle management

**Archival Strategy & Retention**:
- **Regulatory Retention Mapping**: Map each record type to applicable retention requirements (SOC 2: 7 years audit evidence, GDPR: varies by purpose, SOX: 7 years financial records, HIPAA: 6 years minimum)
- **Tiered Storage Strategy**: Implement 4-tier archival approach (Hot: <30 days $0.023/GB, Warm: 30-90 days $0.0125/GB, Cold: 90 days-7 years $0.004/GB, Glacier: 7+ years $0.00099/GB) for 30-50% cost optimization
- **Automated Lifecycle Policies**: Configure cloud-native lifecycle rules (AWS S3 Lifecycle, Azure Blob Lifecycle) to transition data between tiers based on age and access patterns
- **Legal Hold Integration**: Implement automated legal hold capabilities that suspend normal retention schedules and prevent deletion during litigation or investigations
- **Certificate of Destruction**: Generate and retain certificates of destruction for all disposed records with timestamped audit trails for compliance validation

**E-Discovery & Retrieval**:
- **Search Capability**: Ensure archived data remains searchable with <4 hour retrieval SLA for standard requests and <24 hour for bulk e-discovery
- **Indexing Strategy**: Maintain searchable metadata indices separate from archived content to enable fast discovery without full data restoration
- **Chain of Custody**: Document complete chain of custody for all archived records to support legal defensibility and forensic investigations
- **Retrieval Testing**: Conduct quarterly retrieval tests across all archival tiers to validate 99.9% data integrity and accessibility SLAs

**Security & Compliance**:
- **Encryption Standards**: Enforce AES-256 encryption at rest and TLS 1.3 in transit for all archived data, with key rotation every 90 days
- **Access Controls**: Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) with least privilege and MFA for archival system access, logging all retrieval activities
- **Immutability Controls**: Use WORM (Write Once Read Many) storage or object lock features to prevent unauthorized modification or deletion of archived records
- **Annual Compliance Audits**: Conduct annual archival compliance audits validating retention adherence, disposal execution, and legal hold effectiveness
- **Privacy-Aware Archival**: Integrate data classification and privacy labels to ensure PII/PHI archived data meets GDPR Article 32 security requirements

**Operational Excellence**:
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track storage costs monthly by tier and record type, targeting 30-50% reduction through intelligent lifecycle automation
- **Integrity Validation**: Implement quarterly integrity checks using checksums (SHA-256) to detect corruption or bit rot in long-term archives
- **Vendor SLA Monitoring**: For third-party archival services, monitor 99.99% durability SLAs and <12 hour restore times with quarterly vendor reviews
- **Disposition Workflows**: Automate secure disposition using NIST SP 800-88 sanitization standards with audit trail retention for 7 years post-destruction
- **Documentation Requirements**: Maintain comprehensive retention schedules, disposal logs, legal hold registers, and archival system architecture documentation
- **Training & Awareness**: Provide annual training to IT operations, legal, and compliance teams on archival procedures, legal hold protocols, and e-discovery processes
- **Disaster Recovery Integration**: Ensure archived data included in disaster recovery plans with RPO ≤ 24 hours and tested recovery procedures
