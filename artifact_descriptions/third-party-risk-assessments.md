# Name: third-party-risk-assessments

## Executive Summary

Third-Party Risk Assessments (TPRM - Third Party Risk Management) are critical vendor due diligence artifacts providing structured evaluation of vendor security, compliance, financial stability, and operational risks using standardized questionnaires (SIG Lite/Core/Full, CAIQ, VSAQ), SOC 2 Type II reports, ISO 27001 certifications, and penetration test results. This foundational TPRM deliverable enables risk-based vendor selection, ongoing vendor monitoring, and regulatory compliance aligned to NIST SP 800-161, ISO 27036, FFIEC guidance, and industry TPRM frameworks.

As the cornerstone of vendor risk management, this artifact serves Vendor Risk Managers, Procurement Teams, CISOs, Compliance Officers, and Business Owners by providing inherent risk assessment (vendor's baseline risk profile), residual risk calculation (after vendor controls), risk tiering (critical/high/medium/low), and evidence-based vendor approval decisions. It integrates with GRC platforms (ServiceNow TPRM, OneTrust Vendorpedia, Prevalent, RiskRecon, SecurityScorecard) for automated risk scoring, continuous monitoring, and vendor risk dashboards.

### Strategic Importance

- **TPRM Questionnaires**: Leverages standardized questionnaires including SIG (Standardized Information Gathering) Lite/Core/Full, CAIQ (Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire), VSAQ (Vendor Security Assessment Questionnaire) for consistent vendor evaluation
- **Inherent vs Residual Risk**: Assesses inherent vendor risk (baseline risk profile) and residual risk (after vendor controls and contractual mitigations) supporting risk-informed procurement
- **Risk Tiering**: Categorizes vendors into tiers (Tier 1 Critical, Tier 2 High, Tier 3 Medium, Tier 4 Low) based on data sensitivity, business criticality, and regulatory scope determining assessment rigor
- **SOC 2 / ISO 27001 Validation**: Reviews vendor SOC 2 Type II reports, ISO 27001/27701 certificates, penetration test results, and compliance attestations validating security controls
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Enables ongoing vendor risk monitoring through annual reassessments, security ratings (BitSight, SecurityScorecard), breach notifications, and performance metrics
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Satisfies TPRM requirements for FFIEC, OCC, GDPR Article 28, HIPAA Business Associates, PCI DSS 12.8, SOC 2 CC9, NYDFS 23 NYCRR 500, and CMMC vendor assessment
- **Fourth Party Risk**: Extends assessments to vendor subcontractors (fourth parties) when vendors use sub-processors handling organizational data

**Naming Conventions**: Follow organization's document naming standards for consistency and discoverability
**Template Usage**: Use approved templates to ensure completeness and consistency across teams
**Peer Review**: Have at least one qualified peer review before submitting for approval
**Metadata Completion**: Fully complete all metadata fields to enable search, classification, and lifecycle management
**Stakeholder Validation**: Review draft with key stakeholders before finalizing to ensure alignment and buy-in
**Plain Language**: Write in clear, concise language appropriate for the intended audience; avoid unnecessary jargon
**Visual Communication**: Include diagrams, charts, and tables to communicate complex information more effectively
**Traceability**: Reference source materials, related documents, and dependencies to provide context and enable navigation
**Regular Updates**: Review and update on scheduled cadence or when triggered by significant changes
**Approval Evidence**: Maintain clear record of who approved, when, and any conditions or caveats
**Distribution Management**: Clearly communicate where artifact is published and notify stakeholders of updates
**Retention Compliance**: Follow organizational retention policies for how long to maintain and when to archive/destroy
**Executive Sponsorship**: Ensure visible executive sponsorship and regular executive review
**Governance Alignment**: Align with organizational governance framework and decision-making bodies
**Metric-Driven**: Include measurable metrics and KPIs to track progress and outcomes
**Dependency Management**: Explicitly identify and track dependencies on other initiatives or resources
**Risk Integration**: Integrate with risk management processes; escalate risks appropriately
**Change Control**: Submit significant changes through formal change control process
**Audit Trail**: Maintain comprehensive audit trail for governance and compliance purposes
**TPRM Assessment Best Practices**:
**Risk-Based Tiering**: Implement vendor risk tiering (Tier 1-4) based on data classification, business criticality, and regulatory scope to tailor assessment rigor
**Standardized Questionnaires**: Use SIG Lite for low-risk vendors, SIG Core for medium-risk, SIG Full for high-risk/critical vendors to ensure consistency
**SOC 2 Type II Preferred**: Prioritize vendors with current SOC 2 Type II reports (within 12 months) reducing questionnaire burden and assessment time
**Inherent + Residual Risk**: Calculate both inherent risk (before vendor controls) and residual risk (after controls and contractual mitigations)
**Evidence Validation**: Don't accept questionnaire responses alone - validate with SOC 2, ISO 27001 certificates, penetration test reports, insurance certificates
**Right to Audit**: Include contractual right to audit clause enabling on-site assessments for Tier 1/2 vendors or high-risk vendors
**Annual Reassessment**: Conduct annual risk reassessments for Tier 1/2 vendors, biennial for Tier 3, and every 3 years for Tier 4
**Continuous Monitoring**: Integrate continuous monitoring tools (SecurityScorecard, BitSight, RiskRecon) for real-time vendor security posture tracking
**Fourth Party Disclosure**: Require vendors to disclose all subcontractors/sub-processors and assess fourth party risks
**DPA Requirements**: Ensure GDPR-compliant Data Processing Agreement (DPA) for any vendor processing personal data
**Financial Stability**: Assess vendor financial viability using Dun & Bradstreet ratings, financial statements, and credit reports preventing vendor failure risk
**Breach Notification**: Require contractual 24-48 hour breach notification and annual security incident disclosure
**Penetration Testing**: Request penetration test reports for Tier 1/2 vendors and validate critical/high findings are remediated
**Risk Acceptance**: Require executive/risk committee approval for vendors exceeding risk tolerance with documented compensating controls
**TPRM Platform**: Leverage TPRM platform (ServiceNow TPRM, OneTrust, Prevalent) for workflow automation, evidence repository, and vendor risk dashboard
