# Name: contributor-license-agreements

## Executive Summary

Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) are legal instruments that establish intellectual property terms for contributions to open-source projects or corporate codebases. CLAs grant organizations necessary rights to use, modify, and distribute contributed code while protecting both contributors and project maintainers from IP disputes. Leading open-source foundations (Apache Software Foundation, Linux Foundation, Eclipse Foundation) rely on standardized CLAs to enable collaborative development while maintaining clear copyright ownership and patent grant chains.

Modern CLA management has evolved from manual PDF signing to automated workflows using GitHub CLA Assistant, EasyCLA (Linux Foundation), and CLA bots that gate pull requests until contributors sign. Organizations must choose between traditional CLAs (full copyright assignment or broad license grants) and the lightweight Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), popularized by Linux kernel development and enforced through signed-off commits. The choice impacts contribution friction, legal defensibility, patent licensing, and community participation rates.

### Strategic Importance

- **IP Clarity**: Establishes clear copyright ownership and licensing terms preventing future disputes over code provenance and rights
- **Patent Protection**: Secures explicit or implicit patent grants from contributors, protecting project users from patent infringement claims
- **Relicensing Flexibility**: CLA copyright assignment enables future license changes (e.g., GPL to Apache 2.0) without re-contacting all contributors
- **Corporate Indemnification**: Provides legal protection for organizations using open-source projects in commercial products
- **Contribution Verification**: Ensures contributors have authority to contribute code (employer IP agreements, third-party code restrictions)
- **Community Trust**: Transparent CLA terms build contributor confidence that their work won't be misappropriated or relicensed unfairly
- **M&A Clean Room**: Clear contribution lineage accelerates due diligence by documenting IP provenance and licensing rights chain

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact documents the legal agreement between contributors and project maintainers, establishing copyright licensing terms, patent grants, and contribution warranties. It defines whether contributions use copyright assignment (transferring ownership), copyright license (granting broad rights while retaining ownership), or DCO (lightweight certification of contribution authority). The CLA ensures organizations can legally distribute, modify, and sublicense contributed code while providing contributors with predictable treatment of their intellectual property.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Individual Contributor License Agreements (ICLA) for individual developers contributing personal work
- Corporate Contributor License Agreements (CCLA) for employees contributing on behalf of employers
- Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as lightweight alternative to traditional CLAs (signed-off-by commits)
- Copyright licensing terms: perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license grants
- Patent licensing clauses: express patent grants covering contributions and defensive termination provisions
- Contribution warranties: original work, authority to contribute, compliance with employer IP policies
- CLA automation workflows: GitHub CLA Assistant, EasyCLA, CLA bots, DocuSign integration
- CLA record management: contributor database, signature tracking, corporate signatory authorization
- Minor contributor exceptions: trivial contributions, documentation-only changes below CLA threshold

**Out of Scope**:
- Employment IP assignment agreements (employer-employee contracts)
- Consultant/contractor work-for-hire agreements
- Open-source project licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL) that govern project distribution
- End-user license agreements (EULAs) for software users
- Commercial licensing terms for dual-licensed projects
- Transfer of trademark rights or project governance authority

### Target Audience

**Primary Audience**:
- Legal Counsel: CLA drafting, copyright assignment review, patent clause analysis, foundation CLA adaptation
- Open Source Program Office (OSPO): CLA policy selection, automation workflow design, contributor experience optimization
- Project Maintainers: CLA enforcement, pull request gating, contributor onboarding, exception handling
- Engineering Leadership: CLA vs. DCO selection, community impact assessment, contribution friction analysis

**Secondary Audience**:
- Individual Contributors: Understanding IP rights, corporate approval requirements, signing workflow
- Corporate Contributors: CCLA signatory authorization, employee roster management, subsidiary coverage
- Community Managers: Contributor experience, CLA friction reduction, documentation clarity
- M&A Due Diligence Teams: Contribution provenance verification, IP chain-of-title validation, contributor database audit

## Best Practices

**Foundation Template Adoption**: Start with Apache or Linux Foundation CLA templates rather than drafting from scratch to leverage community-vetted language
**CLA vs. DCO Analysis**: Evaluate DCO-only approach for permissive-licensed projects to reduce contributor friction while maintaining IP clarity
**Automated Enforcement**: Implement GitHub CLA Assistant or EasyCLA to gate pull requests until contributors sign, preventing non-compliant merges
**Clear Documentation**: Provide contributor-facing documentation explaining CLA purpose, signing process, and IP implications in plain language
**Employer Approval Guidance**: Document when corporate CLA is required vs. individual CLA, including employee vs. contractor distinctions
**Minor Contribution Threshold**: Define trivial contribution policy (typo fixes, whitespace changes) that may bypass CLA requirements
**Electronic Signature**: Use DocuSign, HelloSign, or CLA Assistant's built-in signing to eliminate paper-based workflows
**CLA Database Maintenance**: Maintain searchable database of signed CLAs with contributor GitHub IDs, email addresses, and corporate affiliations
**Corporate CLA Roster**: For corporate CLAs, maintain authorized contributor lists and update processes for employee changes
**Retroactive Signing**: Have process for retroactive CLA signing when contributions merge before signature (with legal review)
**Patent Grant Clarity**: Explicitly state whether patent grant is contribution-specific or project-wide, and include defensive termination clause
**Version Control Tracking**: Link CLA version to contributions; if CLA terms change, document which version each contributor signed
**Multi-Repository Coverage**: Clarify whether CLA covers all organization repositories or requires per-project signing
**Subsidiary Coverage**: For corporate CLAs, explicitly state whether subsidiaries and affiliates are covered or require separate agreements
**International Considerations**: Review CLA enforceability across jurisdictions, particularly regarding moral rights in civil law countries
**Capacity Verification**: Document special handling for minors, government employees, and academic contributors with institutional restrictions
**CLA Communication**: Send clear onboarding email to new contributors explaining CLA, providing signing link, and offering support contact
**Integration Testing**: Test CLA bot functionality regularly to ensure pull request gating works correctly and doesn't block legitimate contributions
**Public CLA Registry**: Consider publishing list of signed contributors (with consent) to demonstrate community breadth
**Legal Review Cadence**: Have legal counsel review CLA every 2-3 years to incorporate learnings from case law and community feedback
