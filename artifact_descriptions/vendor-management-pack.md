# Name: vendor-management-pack

## Executive Summary

The Vendor Management Pack is a comprehensive vendor lifecycle governance artifact documenting vendor onboarding, ongoing monitoring, contract management, performance tracking, and offboarding procedures aligned to vendor management best practices, TPRM frameworks (NIST SP 800-161, ISO 27036), and procurement standards. This critical deliverable provides end-to-end vendor lifecycle management from vendor selection through contract execution, relationship management, renewal negotiations, and vendor termination ensuring compliance, risk management, and business value optimization.

As the foundational vendor lifecycle framework, this artifact serves Vendor Managers, Procurement Teams, Contract Managers, Vendor Risk Managers, Legal Teams, and Finance/AP Teams by establishing standardized processes, approval workflows, contract templates, due diligence requirements, performance SLAs, and offboarding procedures. It integrates with procurement systems (SAP Ariba, Coupa, Oracle Procurement Cloud), contract management platforms (DocuSign CLM, Ironclad, ContractWorks), and TPRM tools (ServiceNow TPRM, OneTrust Vendorpedia) for automated workflows and centralized vendor repository.

### Strategic Importance

   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
