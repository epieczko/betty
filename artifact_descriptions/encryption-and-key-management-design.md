# Name: encryption-and-key-management-design

## Executive Summary

The Encryption and Key Management Design is a critical security artifact that specifies cryptographic controls, key management infrastructure, encryption mechanisms, and certificate management for protecting data at rest, in transit, and in use. This document defines encryption algorithms (AES-256, RSA-4096), key management services (HSM, KMS), certificate authorities (PKI), and cryptographic protocols (TLS 1.3, mTLS) following industry standards (NIST FIPS 140-2/3, Common Criteria).

As a cornerstone of data protection strategy, this artifact ensures compliance with regulatory requirements (PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR), implements defense-in-depth cryptographic controls, and establishes operational procedures for key lifecycle management (generation, rotation, revocation, backup, recovery). It guides security engineers, cloud architects, and DevOps teams in implementing encryption using platform-native services (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, GCP Cloud KMS) or dedicated HSM solutions while maintaining compliance with cryptographic standards and key custody requirements.

### Strategic Importance

- **Data Protection Compliance**: Demonstrates adherence to encryption requirements in PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, and industry-specific regulations
- **Cryptographic Standards**: Ensures use of NIST-approved algorithms, FIPS 140-2/3 validated modules, and compliance with cryptographic best practices
- **Key Custody & Control**: Establishes clear key ownership, separation of duties, dual control for sensitive operations, and audit trails for key access
- **Incident Response**: Enables rapid key rotation, emergency revocation, and cryptographic incident response for breach scenarios
- **Cloud Security**: Leverages cloud-native KMS (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, GCP Cloud KMS) with customer-managed keys (CMK) and bring-your-own-key (BYOK) options

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
