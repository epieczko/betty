# Name: service-configuration-files

## Executive Summary

Service Configuration Files are the foundational artifacts that define runtime behavior, environment-specific settings, and operational parameters for cloud-native applications. Primarily manifested as Kubernetes ConfigMaps, Secrets, environment variables, and external configuration stores (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, SOPS), these files enable the separation of configuration from code—a critical principle of the Twelve-Factor App methodology.

In modern cloud-native architectures, configuration management extends beyond simple key-value pairs to include sophisticated secret rotation, dynamic configuration injection, GitOps-based configuration delivery, and integration with service mesh configuration sources. This artifact ensures applications remain portable, secure, and adaptable across multiple environments while maintaining audit trails and compliance requirements.

### Strategic Importance

- **Environment Portability**: Enables consistent application behavior across dev, staging, production, and multi-cloud environments
- **Security & Compliance**: Provides secure secret management with encryption at rest, access controls, and audit logging
- **Zero-Downtime Updates**: Supports dynamic configuration reloading without application restarts or pod disruption
- **GitOps Alignment**: Treats configuration as code with version control, peer review, and declarative management
- **Secret Sprawl Prevention**: Centralizes sensitive data management through tools like Vault, External Secrets Operator, and sealed-secrets
- **Configuration Drift Detection**: Enables automated detection and remediation of configuration inconsistencies
- **Compliance Automation**: Enforces policy-as-code for configuration validation using OPA/Gatekeeper and Kyverno

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

- sealed-secrets (Bitnami) for encrypting secrets in Git repositories
- Environment variable injection patterns (envFrom, valueFrom)
- ConfigMap and Secret mounting strategies (volume mounts, environment variables, projected volumes)
- Dynamic configuration providers (Spring Cloud Config, Consul KV, etcd)
- Secret rotation policies and automated rotation mechanisms
- Configuration schema validation and policy enforcement

## Best Practices

**Never Commit Secrets**: Never store unencrypted secrets in Git; use SOPS, sealed-secrets, or external secret references
**Immutable ConfigMaps**: Use immutable ConfigMaps to prevent accidental modifications and enable safe rollbacks
**Least Privilege Access**: Apply RBAC to restrict ConfigMap/Secret access to only authorized service accounts and users
**Encryption at Rest**: Enable Kubernetes etcd encryption and integrate with cloud KMS providers (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, GCP KMS)
**Secret Rotation**: Implement automated secret rotation with tools like External Secrets Operator and Vault
**Configuration Schema**: Define and validate configuration schemas using JSON Schema, CUE, or OPA policies
**Namespace Isolation**: Use namespace-scoped ConfigMaps and Secrets to enforce tenant isolation
**GitOps for Configuration**: Manage all configuration through Git with PR-based reviews and automated sync via ArgoCD/Flux
**Environment Parity**: Maintain consistent configuration structure across environments while varying only values
**Avoid Hardcoding**: Never hardcode configuration in container images; always inject at runtime
**Secret Scanning**: Implement pre-commit hooks and CI/CD checks to prevent accidental secret commits (TruffleHog, GitGuardian)
**Audit Logging**: Enable Kubernetes audit logging for all ConfigMap and Secret access and modifications
**Dynamic References**: Prefer dynamic secret fetching over static mounting when using Vault or cloud secret managers
**Configuration Drift Detection**: Monitor for configuration drift between desired (Git) and actual (cluster) state
**Documentation**: Document all configuration parameters, their purpose, allowed values, and dependencies
**Testing**: Test configuration changes in non-production environments before promoting to production
**Versioning**: Use labels and annotations to track configuration versions and link to source commits
**Rollback Strategy**: Maintain previous ConfigMap/Secret versions to enable quick rollbacks during incidents
**Size Limits**: Keep ConfigMaps under 1MB; use external storage for larger configuration files
**Hot Reloading**: Implement configuration watchers to reload config without pod restarts when possible

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
