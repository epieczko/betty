# Name: data-export-procedures

## Executive Summary

The Data Export Procedures document defines the comprehensive technical, operational, and compliance requirements for exporting customer data, system data, and organizational data from applications, databases, and SaaS platforms. These procedures ensure secure, compliant, and efficient data extraction supporting customer data portability rights (GDPR Article 20, CCPA Section 1798.100), system migrations, disaster recovery, analytics, and regulatory compliance obligations.

Modern data export workflows handle 10GB-10TB+ data volumes across structured databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle), NoSQL stores (MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), and SaaS applications (Salesforce, Workday, ServiceNow). Export procedures must address data format standardization (CSV, JSON, XML, Parquet, Avro), personally identifiable information (PII) protection, encryption requirements (AES-256, TLS 1.3), access controls, audit logging, and retention policies.

Organizations with mature data export procedures achieve 95%+ customer data portability request fulfillment within 30-day GDPR mandates, reduce data export errors by 60-80% through automation and validation, and prevent data breach incidents through encrypted transfer protocols and access controls. Properly documented export procedures support business continuity (12-24 hour RTO for critical systems), enable M&A due diligence, and satisfy SOC 2, ISO 27001, and industry-specific compliance requirements.

### Strategic Importance

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Satisfies GDPR Article 20 data portability, CCPA consumer rights, HIPAA patient data access, and GLBA financial data disclosure requirements
- **Customer Trust**: Enables customer data portability requests, building trust through transparent data ownership and control mechanisms
- **Business Continuity**: Supports disaster recovery procedures, system failover, and data backup/restore operations with defined RTOs and RPOs
- **Data Migration**: Facilitates platform migrations, vendor transitions, and system consolidation through standardized export formats and procedures
- **Analytics & Insights**: Enables data extraction for business intelligence, machine learning, and advanced analytics in data lakes and warehouses
- **Audit & Governance**: Provides auditable data export trails supporting SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and regulatory examination requirements
- **Risk Mitigation**: Prevents data loss, corruption, and unauthorized access through controlled export procedures, encryption, and access logging

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact serves as the authoritative reference for all data export operations, defining technical procedures, security controls, compliance requirements, and operational workflows for extracting data from organizational systems. It solves the challenge of balancing data accessibility for legitimate business needs against security, privacy, and compliance requirements by establishing standardized, auditable, and repeatable export processes. The procedures support decision-making around export request approvals, format selection, encryption methods, and access controls while providing operational teams with step-by-step technical instructions for executing exports safely and efficiently.

## Best Practices

**Encryption by Default**: Encrypt all exported data using AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit, with no exceptions for sensitive or PII data
**Access Control Rigor**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with principle of least privilege, requiring approval workflows for sensitive data exports
**Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Log all export activities capturing user identity, timestamp, data volume, destination, and business justification for compliance and security monitoring
**Data Validation**: Implement automated validation checks confirming export completeness, row counts, checksums, and data integrity before delivering to requesters
**Format Standardization**: Define standard export formats (CSV UTF-8, JSON, Parquet) with documented schemas preventing format inconsistency and import errors
**Incremental Exports**: Leverage incremental export strategies using change data capture (CDC) or timestamp-based filtering reducing processing time and network bandwidth
**Parallel Processing**: Implement parallel export execution for large datasets using partitioning and multi-threading improving export performance 5-10x
**Compression Standards**: Apply gzip, zip, or columnar compression (Parquet, ORC) reducing export file sizes by 60-90% for storage and transfer efficiency
**Chunking Strategy**: Split large exports into manageable chunks (5GB-10GB files) preventing memory exhaustion and enabling resume capability for failed exports
**PII Protection**: Apply pseudonymization, anonymization, or redaction techniques for PII in non-production environments satisfying GDPR privacy-by-design principles
**Automated Scheduling**: Configure automated export schedules using cron jobs, Airflow DAGs, or cloud scheduler services ensuring consistent execution and reducing manual effort
**Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling with automatic retry logic, dead letter queues, and alerting for failed exports preventing silent failures
**Version Control**: Maintain version history of export procedures, scripts, and configurations in Git enabling rollback and change tracking
**Performance Monitoring**: Monitor export execution times, data volumes, and resource utilization establishing performance baselines and identifying optimization opportunities
**Staging Areas**: Use dedicated staging areas or temporary storage for export processing preventing performance impact on production databases
**Resource Throttling**: Implement query throttling and connection pooling preventing export operations from overwhelming source systems
**Data Retention**: Define retention policies for export files (30-90 days) and audit logs (1-7 years) balancing storage costs with compliance requirements
**Secure Transfer**: Use SFTP, SCP, encrypted S3 buckets, or managed file transfer (MFT) solutions for secure export file delivery
**Testing Procedures**: Test export procedures in non-production environments validating data accuracy, performance, and error handling before production deployment
**Documentation Standards**: Maintain comprehensive documentation including procedure steps, technical specifications, troubleshooting guides, and runbooks
**Change Management**: Follow formal change management processes for export procedure modifications requiring approval, testing, and rollback plans
**Compliance Validation**: Regularly review export procedures against GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, SOC 2, and industry requirements ensuring continued compliance
**Customer Communication**: Provide clear communication to customers about data export timelines, formats, and delivery methods satisfying transparency obligations
**Disaster Recovery**: Include export procedures in disaster recovery planning ensuring ability to restore operations and satisfy regulatory obligations during outages
**Privileged Access Management**: Use PAM solutions (CyberArk, BeyondTrust) for managing credentials and access to export systems preventing credential sprawl
