# Name: changelogs

## Executive Summary

The Changelog artifact is a human-readable, chronologically-ordered record of all notable changes across software versions, documenting features, bug fixes, deprecations, security patches, and breaking changes. Following Keep a Changelog format standards, changelogs provide stakeholders with transparent version history, enabling upgrade decisions, regression troubleshooting, and compliance auditing.

Changelogs serve as the comprehensive change history complement to version-specific release notes, maintaining a complete historical record of software evolution. They integrate with Semantic Versioning 2.0.0, Conventional Commits standards, and automated changelog generation tools (conventional-changelog, semantic-release, release-please). Changelogs support open-source transparency, customer upgrade planning, security audit trails, and regulatory compliance documentation (SOC 2, ISO 27001).

### Strategic Importance

- **Version Transparency**: Maintains complete historical record of changes across all versions with Keep a Changelog format
- **Automated Generation**: Supports conventional-changelog, semantic-release, and release-please for git commit-based automation
- **Upgrade Planning**: Enables customers and internal teams to assess upgrade impact by reviewing consolidated change history
- **Security Audit Trail**: Documents all security patches with CVE references for compliance and audit requirements
- **Deprecation Tracking**: Provides clear visibility into deprecated features and their sunset timelines across versions
- **Regression Troubleshooting**: Helps identify when specific changes were introduced for debugging and root cause analysis
- **Compliance Documentation**: Supports SOC 2, ISO 27001, and regulatory change tracking audit requirements

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

Changelogs provide a comprehensive, chronological record of all notable software changes across versions using Keep a Changelog format (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security). They document version history for upgrade planning, regression analysis, security auditing, and compliance tracking, integrating with Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 and Conventional Commits for automated generation.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Keep a Changelog format with standardized sections (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security)
- Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for all version entries
- Chronological version ordering (newest first) with ISO 8601 release dates
- Conventional Commits categorization (feat, fix, refactor, perf, chore, docs, test)
- Breaking changes with BREAKING CHANGE: notation and migration guidance references
- Security patches with CVE identifiers and CVSS severity scores
- Deprecated features with sunset dates and alternative recommendations
- Bug fixes with issue tracker references (GitHub, Jira, Linear)
- Performance improvements with benchmark data or metrics
- Dependency updates for major version bumps
- API changes, configuration modifications, database migrations
- Unreleased section for work in progress between releases
- Yanked releases documentation (versions withdrawn due to critical bugs)
- Links to detailed release notes, pull requests, and documentation
- Automated generation metadata (conventional-changelog, semantic-release, release-please)

**Out of Scope**:
- Detailed version-specific deployment procedures (handled by release notes)
- Internal development workflow details (handled by git commit history)
- Release certification and quality gates (handled by release-certification.md)
- Risk assessments and deployment strategies (handled by release-risk-assessment.md)
- Individual git commit messages (source for automated changelog generation)

### Target Audience

**Primary Audience**:
- Software Engineers reviewing change history for debugging and understanding code evolution
- DevOps Engineers planning upgrades and assessing deployment impact across versions
- Release Managers coordinating releases and communicating changes to stakeholders
- Product Managers tracking feature delivery and understanding product evolution
- Open Source Contributors understanding project history and contribution areas

**Secondary Audience**:
- Security Teams auditing security patch history and vulnerability remediation timelines
- Compliance Officers providing change audit trails for SOC 2, ISO 27001 audits
- Customer Success Teams helping customers plan upgrade timelines and assess impact
- Technical Writers updating documentation based on feature additions and changes
- QA Teams identifying changes requiring regression testing across versions

## Best Practices

**Keep a Changelog Format**: Use standardized sections (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security) for consistency
**Automate from Commits**: Use conventional-changelog or semantic-release to generate from Conventional Commits
**Chronological Ordering**: List versions newest-first with ISO 8601 dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
**Unreleased Section**: Maintain [Unreleased] section at top for changes between releases
**Semantic Versioning**: Follow SemVer 2.0.0 strictly - document version bumps clearly
**Breaking Changes First**: Highlight breaking changes prominently at top of version section
**Link to Details**: Include links to pull requests, issues, CVEs, and detailed documentation
**User-Focused Language**: Write for end users, not just developers - explain impact, not just implementation
**Security Transparency**: Document all security fixes with CVE identifiers and severity levels
**Deprecation Warnings**: Announce deprecations before removal with clear sunset dates
**Migration Guidance Links**: Reference detailed migration guides for breaking changes
**Compare Links**: Provide git diff comparison links between versions (e.g., v1.0.0...v1.1.0)
**Human-Readable**: Keep machine-readable but prioritize human comprehension over perfect automation
**Group Related Changes**: Combine related changes into coherent entries, not one entry per commit
**Omit Trivial Changes**: Exclude internal refactoring, test updates, doc typos unless user-impacting
**Yanked Versions**: Document withdrawn versions with reasons (e.g., [1.0.1] - 2024-03-15 [YANKED])
**Consistent Voice**: Use consistent tense and voice (usually past tense: "Added feature X", "Fixed bug Y")
**Reference Issue Trackers**: Link GitHub issues, Jira tickets, Linear issues for detailed context
**Validate Against Commits**: Ensure changelog entries map to actual git commit history
**Pre-Release Suffixes**: Use -alpha, -beta, -rc suffixes for pre-production versions

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
