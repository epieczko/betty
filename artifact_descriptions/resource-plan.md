# Name: resource-plan

## Executive Summary

The Resource Plan is a strategic portfolio and program management artifact that defines team capacity allocation, technology resource provisioning, budget distribution, and tooling requirements across initiatives and Agile Release Trains (ARTs). This plan optimizes resource utilization across competing demands while maintaining sustainable team velocity and preventing resource contention.

As a foundational planning deliverable aligned with SAFe, PMI portfolio management, and resource management best practices, it quantifies team capacity using story points and FTE allocation, defines infrastructure and tooling needs (Jira, cloud resources, development environments), establishes budget allocations across programs, and creates resource demand forecasts. The plan leverages resource management tools like MS Project, Smartsheet, and portfolio management platforms to visualize capacity constraints and identify bottlenecks.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities directly support organizational objectives and expected outcomes
- **Resource Optimization**: Enables efficient allocation of personnel, budget, and technology resources
- **Risk Management**: Identifies potential obstacles and defines proactive mitigation strategies
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Creates shared understanding of approach, timeline, and expectations
- **Success Measurement**: Establishes clear metrics and criteria for evaluating outcomes

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact provides the resource allocation strategy and capacity planning framework for portfolio and program execution. It enables portfolio managers to make informed decisions about resource investment, identifies capacity constraints before they impact delivery, and ensures optimal resource utilization across concurrent initiatives.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Team capacity planning and FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) allocation across initiatives

- Resource demand forecasting based on product roadmaps and release plans
- Tooling licenses and subscriptions (Jira, Confluence, development IDEs, monitoring tools)
- Cross-functional resource dependencies (shared platform teams, center of excellence support)
- Resource ramp-up and ramp-down schedules aligned with project phases
- Capacity utilization metrics and portfolio health dashboards

**Out of Scope**:
- Individual personnel assignments and work task allocation (covered in sprint planning)
- Detailed project schedules and sprint backlogs
- Performance management and individual career development plans
- Vendor selection and procurement processes
- Organizational change management and restructuring plans

### Target Audience

**Primary Audience**:
- Portfolio Managers who allocate resources across competing initiatives
- Program Managers and Release Train Engineers (RTEs) who manage ART capacity

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
