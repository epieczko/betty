# Name: demo-scripts

## Executive Summary

Demo Scripts provide the choreographed narrative and click-through sequence for product demonstrations, transforming raw product features into compelling stories that resonate with specific buyer personas and address their unique pain points. This artifact applies sales engineering best practices, demo automation methodologies from platforms like Reprise and Consensus, and value selling frameworks (MEDDIC, SPIN Selling, Challenger Sale) to solve the problem of generic "feature tours" that showcase everything but sell nothing.

Drawing on proven demo frameworks—discovery-driven demonstrations, problem-agitate-solve narratives, and outcome-focused storytelling—these scripts guide Sales Engineers, Account Executives, and Solution Consultants through customized demo flows that lead with business value, handle common objections proactively, and create "aha moments" that advance deals. The scripts include setup instructions, data preparation, navigation paths, talk tracks, discovery questions, objection responses, proof points, and recovery strategies for when demos go sideways—because they always do.

## Best Practices

**Discovery Before Demo**: Never demo blind; run discovery to understand pain points, success criteria, technical requirements, and decision process; customize demo to what you learned
**Lead with Value Not Features**: Start with business outcome ("reduce manual processing time 70%"), not product capability ("we have automation"); outcomes sell, features inform
**Show Don't Tell**: Demonstrate the value, don't just talk about it; "Here's how you'd save 10 hours per week" with actual workflow > feature list presentation
**Use Realistic Data**: Demo with data that mirrors prospect's environment—their industry, use case, scale; generic "Acme Corp" data loses credibility
**The 10-Minute Rule**: Hook them in first 10 minutes with biggest "wow" moment; lose them early and you've lost them forever; save minor features for later
**Tell a Story**: Structure demo as narrative with character (persona), challenge (pain point), journey (using product), and resolution (value realized); stories stick, feature tours don't
**Pause for Interaction**: Every 5-7 minutes, pause for questions, engagement, or prospect input; monologue demos lose audience; dialogue builds engagement
**Handle Objections Proactively**: Address known concerns before they're raised; "You might be wondering about security..." disarms objection before it becomes blocker
**Proof Points at the Ready**: Have customer stories, metrics, case studies queued for each demo beat; abstract claims need concrete evidence
**Time-Box Ruthlessly**: 30-minute demo means 25 minutes presenting, 5 minutes buffer; running over signals poor preparation and disrespects prospect's time
**Customize by Persona**: Economic buyer wants ROI and risk mitigation; technical buyer wants architecture and integration; end user wants usability and productivity; one demo doesn't fit all
**Practice the Transitions**: Clunky navigation between features breaks flow; practice click paths until they're muscle memory; fluency signals product mastery
**Have a Backup Plan**: Wi-Fi fails, demo environment breaks, screen share glitches; have video backup, offline screenshots, or alternate path ready
**Feature Flagging**: Don't show half-baked features or irrelevant capabilities; configure demo environment to showcase only what matters for this prospect
**Competitive Landmines**: Know competitor's demo and plant subtle traps; "Notice how we do X in one click... many tools require 5 steps for this"; indirect wins trust
**End with Clear CTA**: Don't let demo fizzle out; end decisively with next steps, mutual action plan, and commitment from both sides
**Record and Review**: Record demos (with permission) and review for improvement; what worked, what flopped, what questions surprised you
**Avoid Jargon**: Prospect doesn't know your internal product terminology; speak their language from their industry, not your product names
**Speed Optimization**: Audiences get impatient; show fast product loading, quick searches, instant results; slow demos feel like slow product
**Mobile Matters**: If you have mobile app, show it; 70%+ users will access on mobile; desktop-only demo misses their reality
**Integration Showcase**: B2B buyers care about ecosystem; show Salesforce/Slack/whatever integrations that matter to their stack
**Silence is Golden**: After asking question or making key point, pause; don't fill silence; let it land and let prospect respond
**Screen Real Estate**: Use highest resolution, hide desktop clutter, close unnecessary apps, maximize demo window; messy screen signals disorganization
**Annotate as You Go**: Use cursor highlighting, on-screen annotation tools to draw attention; verbal "click here" loses attention; visual arrows guide eyes
