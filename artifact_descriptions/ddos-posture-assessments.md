# Name: ddos-posture-assessments

## Executive Summary

The DDoS Posture Assessments artifact provides comprehensive evaluation of an organization's defensive capabilities against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks across network, application, and infrastructure layers. This assessment systematically evaluates detection capabilities, mitigation controls, response procedures, and recovery mechanisms to identify gaps and optimize the organization's resilience against volumetric, protocol, and application-layer DDoS attacks.

As both a risk assessment and capability maturity evaluation, this artifact serves security operations teams implementing DDoS defenses and executive leadership requiring assurance that critical services can withstand sustained attack campaigns. It provides actionable recommendations for improving defensive posture, validates existing controls, and demonstrates compliance with regulatory requirements for availability and resilience.
