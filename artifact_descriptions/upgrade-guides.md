# Name: upgrade-guides

## Executive Summary

Upgrade Guides provide comprehensive procedures for migrating from one software version to another, documenting breaking changes, migration paths, rollback procedures, and compatibility considerations. Following change management best practices and the Di√°taxis Framework's how-to format, upgrade documentation addresses pre-upgrade planning, backup procedures, step-by-step upgrade execution, post-upgrade verification, and rollback strategies to ensure safe, successful version transitions with minimal downtime.

These guides implement risk mitigation strategies through comprehensive pre-upgrade checklists, automated compatibility testing, database migration scripts with rollback capabilities, and phased upgrade approaches (blue-green deployments, canary releases, rolling updates). Written following the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide with clear procedural language, upgrade guides include version compatibility matrices, breaking change analysis, deprecated feature warnings, data migration procedures, and testing validation steps to minimize upgrade risks and ensure business continuity.

## Best Practices

**Comprehensive Pre-Upgrade Planning**: Create detailed pre-upgrade checklist (compatibility, dependencies, backups), document current system state and configuration, identify breaking changes and required code changes, estimate downtime and schedule maintenance window, test upgrade in staging environment first, prepare rollback plan before starting, communicate upgrade schedule to all stakeholders, and obtain necessary change approvals

**Breaking Changes Front-and-Center**: Document all breaking changes at the top of upgrade guide, categorize by impact severity (critical, high, medium, low), provide code migration examples for API changes, document configuration file format changes, identify deprecated features being removed, provide automated migration scripts when possible, and link to detailed migration guides for complex changes

**Version Path Documentation**: Clearly state which versions can upgrade directly, document required intermediate upgrade steps (e.g., must upgrade to v2.5 before v3.0), provide skip-upgrade guidance when supported, maintain compatibility matrix across all versions, document unsupported upgrade paths, include version detection commands, and provide downgrade procedures if supported

**Backup and Rollback First**: Mandate backup verification before upgrade starts, provide specific backup commands for databases and config, include backup validation procedures, document point-in-time recovery options, provide detailed rollback procedures for each upgrade step, test rollback in staging environment, set rollback decision criteria and timelines, and document data consistency checks after rollback

**Database Migration Excellence**: Provide schema migration scripts with version control, test migrations against production-sized datasets, include forward and backward migration scripts, document expected migration duration, provide progress monitoring commands, handle long-running migrations gracefully, include data validation queries, and provide rollback for each migration step

**Zero-Downtime Strategies**: Document blue-green deployment procedures, provide rolling update sequences for clusters, include load balancer configuration changes, document database migration with backward compatibility, provide feature flag strategies for gradual rollout, include canary deployment monitoring, and define rollback triggers during phased rollout

**Automated Testing Integration**: Provide pre-upgrade compatibility test scripts, include automated smoke tests for post-upgrade validation, document expected test results and success criteria, automate regression testing for critical functionality, include performance benchmark comparisons, provide health check automation, and integrate with CI/CD pipelines

**Clear Step-by-Step Procedures**: Number all upgrade steps sequentially, begin each step with action verb (Backup, Stop, Upgrade, Verify), include expected output after each command, provide verification commands between major steps, estimate time for each section, highlight points of no return, include progress indicators for long-running operations, and document safe stopping points

**Troubleshooting Integration**: Anticipate common upgrade failures and document solutions inline, provide diagnostic commands for each failure scenario, include log file locations and error patterns, document recovery procedures for partial upgrades, provide contact escalation paths, include known issues and workarounds, and maintain FAQ of upgrade questions

**Version-Specific Guides**: Maintain separate upgrade guide for each version transition (v2.x to v3.x), clearly indicate source and target versions, update guides promptly with each release, archive outdated upgrade paths with warnings, document cumulative changes for skip-upgrades, and provide release notes links for full context

**Multi-Component Coordination**: Document upgrade order for multi-tier applications, include service dependency upgrade sequences, coordinate database and application upgrades, document API gateway and service mesh upgrades, provide cluster-wide upgrade orchestration, and include external dependency validation

**Monitoring and Validation**: Establish baseline metrics before upgrade, monitor key metrics during upgrade execution, provide real-time health check commands, document expected metric changes post-upgrade, include performance validation procedures, set alerting thresholds during upgrade, and provide dashboards for upgrade monitoring

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

‚ùå **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ‚úì *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

‚ùå **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ‚úì *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

‚ùå **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ‚úì *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

‚ùå **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ‚úì *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

‚ùå **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ‚úì *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

‚ùå **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ‚úì *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

‚ùå **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ‚úì *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

‚ùå **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ‚úì *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
