# Name: pipeline-definitions

## Executive Summary

The Pipeline Definitions artifact is a comprehensive specification for CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines, documenting build, test, security scanning, and deployment automation using platforms like Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Azure DevOps, or Tekton. This artifact defines pipeline stages, job configurations, artifact management, deployment strategies, and quality gates that enable teams to deliver software reliably, securely, and at scale.

As organizations adopt DevOps practices and shift-left security, this artifact serves DevOps Engineers implementing pipeline automation, Platform Engineers managing CI/CD infrastructure, SRE Teams ensuring deployment reliability, Security Engineers integrating security scanning (SAST, DAST, SCA), and Software Engineers contributing to pipeline-as-code. It transforms manual deployment processes into automated, repeatable workflows with built-in quality controls, security checks, and compliance validation.

## Best Practices

**Pipeline as Code**: Store all pipeline definitions in version control alongside application code, enable code review for pipeline changes
**Fail Fast**: Run fast tests and checks early in pipeline, fail quickly on errors to provide rapid feedback
**Idempotency**: Design pipeline stages to be idempotent and rerunnable without side effects
**Modular Design**: Break pipelines into reusable stages/jobs, use shared libraries (Jenkins shared libraries, GitHub Actions composite actions)
**Security First**: Integrate security scanning at every stage (SAST, DAST, SCA, secrets scanning), fail on critical vulnerabilities
**Least Privilege**: Use minimal permissions for pipeline execution, rotate credentials regularly, avoid hardcoded secrets
**Environment Parity**: Maintain consistency across dev/staging/prod, use infrastructure as code for environment provisioning
**Approval Gates**: Require manual approval for production deployments, implement change advisory board (CAB) integration
**Automated Testing**: Achieve high test coverage, run tests in parallel for speed, maintain fast feedback loops
**Artifact Traceability**: Tag artifacts with commit SHA, build number, semantic version, maintain artifact provenance
**Caching Strategy**: Cache dependencies and build outputs, use layer caching for Docker builds, optimize build times
**Monitoring**: Track pipeline metrics (build duration, success rate, deployment frequency), alert on failures, dashboard DORA metrics
**Rollback Capability**: Always maintain ability to rollback deployments, test rollback procedures regularly

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
