# Name: functional-requirements-specification

## Executive Summary

The Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) is the authoritative document that defines what a system must do from a functional perspective, serving as the contractual foundation between business stakeholders and development teams. Created using industry-standard frameworks like IEEE 29148, IREB/CPRE requirements engineering practices, and managed in tools like Jira, Azure DevOps, or IBM DOORS Next, this artifact transforms business needs into precise, testable, and traceable functional specifications.

This comprehensive requirements artifact documents user roles, business rules, workflows, system behaviors, data requirements, and acceptance criteria using structured methodologies including Behavior-Driven Development (BDD/Gherkin), user story mapping, and MoSCoW prioritization. It bridges the gap between business vision and technical implementation, ensuring all stakeholders—Business Analysts, Product Managers, System Architects, Developers, and QA Engineers—share a common understanding of functional scope and validation criteria.

## Best Practices

**Requirements Elicitation**: Conduct structured elicitation workshops with stakeholders; use techniques like interviews, observation, prototyping, and story mapping
**Unique Identifiers**: Assign unique IDs to each functional requirement (e.g., FR-001) for traceability through RTM
**Atomic Requirements**: Write single, testable requirements; avoid compound statements that contain multiple requirements
**User Story Format**: Use "As a [role], I want [capability], so that [benefit]" format for user-centric requirements
**Acceptance Criteria**: Define clear, measurable acceptance criteria using Given-When-Then (Gherkin) format for each requirement
**MoSCoW Prioritization**: Categorize requirements as Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have to manage scope
**Business Rules Separation**: Document business rules separately with unique identifiers and trace to related functional requirements
**Wireframes and Mockups**: Include UI wireframes or mockups for interface-heavy requirements to clarify expectations
**Version Control**: Store in requirements management tools (Jira, Azure DevOps, DOORS) or Git with full version history
**Bidirectional Traceability**: Maintain traceability to source business needs and forward to design, code, and test cases
**Requirements Validation**: Conduct formal reviews with business stakeholders to validate accuracy and completeness
**Testability Check**: Ensure every requirement is testable with measurable success criteria
**Ambiguity Elimination**: Use precise, unambiguous language; avoid terms like "user-friendly," "fast," or "flexible"
**Dependency Documentation**: Explicitly document dependencies between requirements and external systems
**Change Impact Analysis**: Assess impact of requirement changes on design, development, testing, and documentation
**Baseline Management**: Establish requirement baselines; use formal change control for post-baseline modifications
**Stakeholder Sign-off**: Obtain formal approval from business stakeholders before proceeding to design phase
**Requirements Reuse**: Leverage requirement patterns and templates for common scenarios to ensure consistency

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
