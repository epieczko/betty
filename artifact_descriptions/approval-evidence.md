# Name: approval-evidence

## Executive Summary

The Approval Evidence artifact provides tamper-evident documentation of formal approvals required for SOC 2 Type II audits, ISO 27001 certifications, and regulatory compliance programs. This governance artifact captures digital signatures, email approvals, workflow system records, and committee meeting minutes to demonstrate appropriate authorization for policies, procedures, control changes, and risk acceptance decisions.

In modern compliance programs using platforms like Vanta, Drata, or Secureframe, approval evidence is automatically collected from integrated systems (Slack, email, Jira, ServiceNow) and maintained with cryptographic integrity. This artifact serves as the authoritative record for auditors examining SOC 2 CC1.4 (commitment and accountability), ISO 27001 Clause 5.1 (leadership and commitment), and regulatory requirements like GDPR Article 24 (controller responsibility) and HIPAA 164.308(a)(2) (assigned security responsibility).

The approval evidence repository enables organizations to demonstrate: 1) policy review cycles averaging 12 months with 100% executive sign-off, 2) change approval workflows with 95%+ adherence to segregation of duties requirements, 3) audit finding remediation with documented CISO approval within defined SLAs (Critical: 15 days, High: 30 days, Medium: 60 days, Low: 90 days), and 4) continuous compliance monitoring with real-time approval tracking reducing audit preparation time by 60-75%.

### Strategic Importance

- **Audit Readiness**: Provides immediately accessible evidence for SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA audits, reducing audit cycles by 40-50%
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Demonstrates due diligence for GDPR, CCPA, SOX, GLBA, and industry-specific regulations requiring documented approvals
- **Non-Repudiation**: Maintains cryptographic proof of who approved what and when, supporting forensic investigations and legal proceedings
- **Control Effectiveness**: Validates that segregation of duties and least privilege principles are enforced through multi-party approval workflows
- **Risk Management**: Documents risk acceptance decisions by appropriate authorities, creating audit trail for board and executive oversight
- **Workflow Automation**: Integrates with GRC platforms (ServiceNow GRC, Archer, MetricStream) to automate evidence collection and reduce manual effort by 70%+
- **Compliance Efficiency**: Supports continuous compliance models that reduce point-in-time audit preparation from months to days

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact establishes the authoritative repository of approval records required to demonstrate compliance with SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria (particularly CC1.4, CC2.2, CC3.3), ISO 27001 Annex A controls (A.5.1, A.6.1, A.12.1), and regulatory requirements mandating documented authorization for security, privacy, and operational changes. The approval evidence collection provides auditors with tamper-evident proof that policies, procedures, system changes, risk acceptances, and exception requests received appropriate review and authorization from designated authorities before implementation. This artifact solves the critical audit challenge of demonstrating retrospective compliance by maintaining time-stamped, digitally signed, or workflow-validated records of who approved what, when they approved it, what they reviewed, and under what authority they acted, enabling organizations to pass SOC 2 Type II audits with zero findings related to authorization controls and reducing evidence collection time during audits by 60-75% through automated aggregation from workflow systems, email archives, document management platforms, and GRC tools.

### Scope

## Best Practices

**Automated Evidence Collection**: Integrate approval workflows with GRC platforms (Vanta, Drata, Secureframe, ServiceNow GRC) to automatically capture and store approval evidence in real-time, reducing manual effort by 70%+
**Tamper-Evident Storage**: Store approval records in write-once-read-many (WORM) storage or blockchain-backed systems to prevent post-facto modification and maintain audit trail integrity
**Cryptographic Timestamping**: Use RFC 3161 timestamping authorities or blockchain timestamps to create verifiable proof-of-existence for approval records
**Multi-Factor Approval Authentication**: Require MFA for high-risk approvals (production changes, privileged access, risk acceptances) to strengthen non-repudiation
**Segregation of Duties Validation**: Implement automated checks that prevent same person from requesting and approving changes, enforcing SOX and PCI-DSS requirements
**Approval SLA Monitoring**: Track time-to-approval metrics and send escalation notifications when approvals exceed defined SLAs (Critical: 4 hours, High: 24 hours, Medium: 3 days, Low: 5 days)
**Complete Approval Context**: Capture not just signature but also: what document version was approved, what changes were reviewed, any conditions or caveats, and applicable policies
**Email Header Preservation**: When using email approvals, preserve complete RFC 5322 headers including DKIM, SPF, and DMARC validation results for authenticity verification
**Approval Delegation Controls**: Maintain clear delegation of authority matrix showing who can approve on behalf of whom and under what circumstances, with time-limited delegations
**Periodic Re-Approval**: Require annual or semi-annual re-approval of policies, access grants, and risk acceptances to validate continued appropriateness
**Approval Metrics Dashboards**: Maintain real-time dashboards showing approval velocity, bottlenecks, overdue approvals, and approval bypass/exception rates
**Approval Trail Completeness**: For multi-stage approvals, capture complete chain-of-custody showing each approval step, not just final approval
**Retention Alignment**: Retain approval evidence for minimum of 7 years for SOX compliance, or longer based on industry requirements (healthcare: indefinite, financial services: 7+ years)
**Audit-Ready Packaging**: Maintain pre-packaged approval evidence collections organized by control domain (access management, change management, policy governance, vendor management) for rapid audit response
**Approval Authority Validation**: Maintain current role-based access control (RBAC) configurations that map job titles/roles to approval authorities, with quarterly reviews
**Conditional Approval Tracking**: For approvals granted with conditions or compensating controls, track condition fulfillment and automatic expiration if conditions aren't met
**Emergency Approval Procedures**: Document and track emergency/break-glass approvals with mandatory post-facto review within 24-48 hours by appropriate authority
**Integration Quality Checks**: Implement automated validation that approval records contain all required fields (approver identity, timestamp, artifact reference, approval type) before acceptance
**Approval Workflow Testing**: Conduct quarterly testing of approval workflow automation to verify evidence is captured correctly and control gaps are identified
**Legal Hold Preservation**: Implement legal hold capabilities that prevent deletion of approval evidence related to litigation, regulatory investigations, or disputes
**Continuous Monitoring**: Deploy automated monitoring that alerts when approval evidence is missing for required activities (policy changes, access grants, risk acceptances)
**Blockchain Anchoring**: For highest-risk approvals, anchor approval hashes to public blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum) to create immutable timestamp proof
**Approval Analytics**: Analyze approval patterns to identify rubber-stamping, approval shopping, or control circumvention behaviors
**Third-Party Approval Evidence**: When using external service providers, ensure SLAs require they maintain and provide approval evidence for their systems/processes affecting your environment
