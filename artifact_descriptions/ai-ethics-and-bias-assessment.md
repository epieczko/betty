# Name: ai-ethics-and-bias-assessment

## Executive Summary

The AI Ethics and Bias Assessment is a critical deliverable for evaluating machine learning models and AI systems for fairness, equity, and ethical risks. This artifact provides structured analysis of protected attributes, demographic parity, disparate impact, and equalized odds across model predictions to ensure responsible AI deployment.

This assessment leverages frameworks like NIST AI Risk Management Framework, EU AI Act compliance criteria, and fairness toolkits including Fairlearn, AI Fairness 360 (AIF360), and Google's What-If Tool. It documents bias testing methodologies, confusion matrix analysis by demographic groups, and fairness metrics such as demographic parity difference, equal opportunity difference, and calibration by group.

The assessment enables ML Engineers, Data Scientists, and AI Governance Teams to identify algorithmic bias, test for disparate impact (80% rule from EEOC guidelines), conduct COMPAS-style recidivism analysis comparisons, and implement bias mitigation strategies including pre-processing (reweighting, resampling), in-processing (adversarial debiasing, prejudice remover), and post-processing (equalized odds, calibrated equalized odds) techniques.

### Strategic Importance

- **Responsible AI**: Ensures AI systems meet ethical standards and fairness principles across protected classes
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Supports EU AI Act, GDPR Article 22, EEOC guidelines, and Fair Lending laws
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifies and quantifies algorithmic bias, disparate impact, and discriminatory outcomes
- **Stakeholder Trust**: Demonstrates commitment to fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI systems
- **Legal Protection**: Documents due diligence in bias testing to defend against discrimination claims
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Establishes baseline fairness metrics for ongoing model monitoring and drift detection
- **Model Governance**: Provides evidence for model approval gates and ethical AI review boards

## Best Practices

**Fairness Metric Selection**: Choose metrics appropriate for use case (demographic parity for equal representation, equalized odds for equal error rates); no single metric captures all fairness definitions
**Multiple Metrics Analysis**: Evaluate multiple fairness metrics as they can be mutually exclusive; document tradeoffs between fairness and performance
**Intersectional Analysis**: Test for intersectional bias across compound protected classes (e.g., race AND gender); use disaggregated analysis
**Baseline Comparison**: Compare model fairness to baseline (random classifier, simple rules, human decision-makers); establish improvement thresholds
**Temporal Stability**: Test fairness across time periods and data cohorts; monitor for fairness drift in production
**Proxy Variable Detection**: Use correlation analysis and SHAP values to identify features that encode protected attributes indirectly
**Confusion Matrix by Group**: Always report TPR, FPR, FNR, TNR by protected class; visualize disparities with heatmaps
**80% Rule Testing**: Apply EEOC four-fifths rule to selection rates; document when adverse impact thresholds are exceeded
**Pre-deployment Testing**: Conduct bias assessment before production deployment; make fairness analysis a required approval gate
**Mitigation Documentation**: Document all bias mitigation attempts, techniques used, and their effectiveness; track fairness-performance tradeoffs
**Stakeholder Input**: Engage domain experts, affected communities, and ethicists in defining fairness requirements
**Tool Triangulation**: Use multiple fairness toolkits (Fairlearn, AIF360, Aequitas) to cross-validate findings
**Version Control**: Store bias assessments in Git alongside model code; link assessments to specific model versions
**Reproducibility**: Provide code, data splits, and random seeds to reproduce fairness analysis; use containerization
**Legal Review**: Have legal counsel review findings for regulatory compliance before high-risk deployments
**Plain Language Summary**: Include executive summary explaining bias findings in non-technical terms
**Visual Communication**: Use fairness dashboards, demographic performance charts, and MetricFrame visualizations
**Regular Reassessment**: Re-run bias assessment quarterly or when model is retrained; monitor production fairness metrics
**Documentation Standards**: Follow Model Cards template including fairness evaluation section
**Audit Trail**: Maintain complete audit trail of bias testing, remediation decisions, and approval processes
