# Name: configuration-design

## Executive Summary

Configuration Design documents define application and infrastructure configuration strategies, including environment-specific settings, feature flags, secrets management, and configuration-as-code approaches. This artifact ensures applications can be deployed consistently across environments while maintaining security, scalability, and operational flexibility through externalized configuration management.

As a critical DevOps and platform engineering deliverable, configuration design integrates industry-standard tools (Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes ConfigMaps, HashiCorp Vault) and methodologies (12-Factor App, GitOps, Infrastructure as Code) to separate configuration from code. This approach enables teams to manage environment promotion, implement feature toggles, secure sensitive data, and support multi-tenancy while adhering to compliance requirements and operational best practices.

### Strategic Importance

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures activities and decisions support organizational objectives
- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
