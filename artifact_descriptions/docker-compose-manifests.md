# Name: docker-compose-manifests

## Executive Summary

The Docker Compose Manifests artifact defines multi-container application orchestration for local development, testing, and small-scale production deployments using Docker Compose. This artifact specifies service definitions, networking configurations, volume mounts, environment variable management, health checks, resource constraints, and service dependencies to enable consistent, reproducible containerized environments across development teams. It provides YAML-based infrastructure-as-code for orchestrating application stacks with databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB), caching layers (Redis, Memcached), message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka), and supporting services through declarative compose file specifications (v3.8+).

As a foundational tool for containerized application development and deployment, this artifact serves DevOps Engineers automating local development environments, Cloud Platform Engineers prototyping infrastructure patterns, Backend Developers requiring consistent test environments, and Site Reliability Engineers managing Docker Swarm deployments. It bridges the gap between local development and production Kubernetes deployments by providing a simplified orchestration model for multi-container applications while maintaining production-ready configuration patterns.

### Strategic Importance

- **Standardization**: Promotes consistent approach and quality across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates risks through structured analysis
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Facilitates clear, consistent communication among diverse audiences
- **Knowledge Management**: Captures and disseminates institutional knowledge and best practices
- **Compliance**: Supports adherence to regulatory, policy, and contractual requirements
- **Continuous Improvement**: Enables measurement, learning, and process refinement

## Purpose & Scope

### Primary Purpose

This artifact defines Docker Compose configurations to orchestrate multi-container applications for local development, integration testing, CI/CD pipelines, and Docker Swarm production deployments, enabling developers to spin up complete application stacks (frontend, backend, databases, caches, queues) with a single `docker-compose up` command.

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Docker Compose file specifications (compose file v3.8, v3.9, and Compose Specification)
- Service definitions (image, build context, ports, networks, volumes, environment variables)
- Multi-container application orchestration (web servers, APIs, databases, caches, message brokers)
- Network configurations (bridge networks, overlay networks, custom networks, network aliases)
- Volume management (named volumes, bind mounts, tmpfs mounts, volume drivers)
- Environment variable management (.env files, environment sections, variable substitution)
- Health check definitions (HTTP probes, TCP probes, command-based health checks)
- Service dependencies and startup ordering (depends_on, service_healthy conditions)
- Resource constraints (CPU limits, memory limits, reservations, PIDs limit)
- Secrets management (Docker secrets, environment variable encryption)
- Logging configurations (json-file, syslog, journald, fluentd drivers)
- Restart policies (no, always, on-failure, unless-stopped)
- Profile configurations for environment-specific overrides (development, testing, production)
- Extension fields and YAML anchors for DRY configuration

**Out of Scope**:
- Production Kubernetes deployments (covered by helm-charts and Kubernetes manifest artifacts)
- Dockerfile build instructions (covered by dockerfiles artifact)
- Container registry management and image distribution
- Large-scale container orchestration with auto-scaling (use Kubernetes/ECS/EKS instead)

- DevOps Engineers creating reproducible development environments
- Cloud Platform Engineers prototyping infrastructure patterns
- Backend Developers requiring local multi-service testing environments
- QA Engineers running integration test suites
- Site Reliability Engineers managing Docker Swarm deployments

**Secondary Audience**:

## Best Practices

**Version Control**: Store docker-compose.yml in Git with .env.example (never commit .env with secrets)
**Compose File Version**: Use Compose Specification or v3.8+ for latest features and Docker Swarm compatibility
**Service Naming**: Use descriptive service names matching architecture (frontend, api, postgres, redis, nginx)
**Image Pinning**: Always pin specific image versions (`postgres:15.3-alpine`) rather than `latest` to ensure reproducibility
**Environment Variables**: Use .env files for configuration, provide .env.example as template, add .env to .gitignore
**Secrets Management**: Use Docker secrets for production Swarm deployments, environment variables for development, never hardcode credentials
**Health Checks**: Define health checks for all services to enable proper dependency ordering and automatic restart on failure
**Resource Limits**: Set memory and CPU limits to prevent resource exhaustion (`mem_limit: 512m`, `cpus: '0.5'`)
**Named Volumes**: Use named volumes for persistent data (databases, uploaded files) to survive container recreation
**Custom Networks**: Create custom bridge networks to isolate services and enable DNS-based service discovery
**Dependency Management**: Use `depends_on` with `service_healthy` condition to ensure proper startup ordering
**Build Context**: Optimize build context size using .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files from build
**Multi-Stage Builds**: Reference Dockerfiles using multi-stage builds for optimized production images
**Port Mapping**: Avoid port conflicts by using non-standard ports or port ranges for local development
**Volume Mounts**: Use relative paths and consistent mount points for development volume binds
**Logging Configuration**: Configure appropriate logging drivers (json-file with max-size/max-file rotation)
**Restart Policies**: Set `restart: unless-stopped` for production services, `restart: no` for one-off commands
**Profiles**: Use compose profiles to separate development vs production service configurations
**YAML Anchors**: Use YAML anchors and extensions to reduce duplication in compose files
**Override Files**: Maintain docker-compose.override.yml for local developer-specific customizations (git-ignored)
**Documentation**: Include README.md with setup instructions, required .env variables, and common commands
**Testing**: Test compose stack with `docker-compose config` to validate YAML syntax before deployment
**Clean Shutdown**: Use `docker-compose down -v` cautiously (removes volumes), prefer `docker-compose down` for normal shutdown
**Regular Updates**: Review and update base images and compose file quarterly, test for breaking changes
**Retention Compliance**: Follow organizational retention policies for how long to maintain and when to archive/destroy

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
