# Name: installation-guides

## Executive Summary

Installation Guides provide step-by-step instructions for deploying software, configuring systems, and setting up environments from initial prerequisites through final verification. Following the Di√°taxis Framework's how-to guide format, installation documentation addresses multiple deployment scenarios (bare metal, virtual machines, containers, cloud platforms, package managers) with platform-specific instructions, prerequisite checks, troubleshooting guidance, and verification steps to ensure successful installations.

These guides implement docs-as-code practices, storing documentation alongside deployment automation (Ansible playbooks, Terraform modules, Helm charts, Docker Compose files) in version control, testing installation procedures in CI/CD pipelines, and maintaining version-specific documentation synchronized with software releases. Written in clear, procedural language following the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide, installation guides include command examples with expected output, prerequisite validation scripts, common error resolutions, and rollback procedures to minimize deployment friction and reduce time-to-value.

### Strategic Importance

## Best Practices

**Test Every Step**: Execute each installation step in clean environment before documenting, test on all supported platforms and versions, verify expected output matches documentation, include validation commands after each major step, document actual error messages encountered, test troubleshooting procedures, and maintain automated testing of installation procedures

**Clear Prerequisites**: List all requirements upfront (hardware, software, network, permissions), provide prerequisite validation scripts or commands, document minimum and recommended specifications, specify version compatibility clearly, identify optional vs. required dependencies, include storage and network capacity planning, and provide prerequisite installation guides

**Procedural Clarity**: Begin each step with action verb (Install, Configure, Verify), number steps sequentially with sub-steps, include expected output after each command, highlight commands in code blocks with copy buttons, explain parameters and options clearly, warn before destructive or irreversible operations, and provide estimated time for each section

**Platform-Specific Instructions**: Use tabbed content for platform variations (Linux/Windows/macOS), document platform-specific commands and paths, address platform-specific prerequisites, provide native package manager instructions, include container and cloud platform options, and maintain consistent structure across platforms

**Code Examples with Context**: Provide complete, copy-pasteable commands, show full command syntax with all required parameters, include environment variable substitution examples, demonstrate both interactive and automated installation, provide sample configuration files with inline comments, and show both development and production configurations

**Verification Steps**: Include health check commands after installation, provide smoke test procedures, document expected service status output, include log verification steps, show how to verify network connectivity, provide database connection tests, and include rollback verification if needed

**Troubleshooting Integration**: Anticipate common errors and provide inline solutions, document error messages verbatim for searchability, provide diagnostic commands for each failure mode, include log file locations and analysis tips, offer workarounds for known issues, provide rollback procedures when installation fails, and link to extended troubleshooting guides

**Security-First Approach**: Never include actual credentials in examples (use placeholders), document secure credential storage methods, include TLS/SSL configuration procedures, document least-privilege service account setup, provide security hardening steps, include firewall configuration guidance, and reference security benchmarks (CIS)

**Automation Support**: Provide infrastructure-as-code examples (Terraform, CloudFormation), include Ansible playbook examples, offer Docker Compose files for quick setup, document API-based installation endpoints, provide silent/unattended installation options, include configuration management templates, and maintain compatibility with CI/CD pipelines

**Version-Specific Documentation**: Maintain separate documentation for each major version, clearly indicate version applicability, provide migration notes between versions, archive deprecated installation methods, update promptly when releases occur, maintain compatibility matrices, and document version-specific prerequisites

**Progressive Disclosure**: Offer quick-start for common scenarios first, provide detailed installation for advanced scenarios, link to separate advanced configuration guides, defer tuning to post-installation documentation, focus on getting working installation first, and provide "next steps" after successful installation

**Offline Installation Support**: Document offline/air-gapped installation procedures, provide dependency bundle download instructions, include package repository setup for offline use, document license file installation for air-gapped environments, and maintain checksums for download verification

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

‚ùå **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ‚úì *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

‚ùå **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ‚úì *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

‚ùå **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ‚úì *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

‚ùå **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ‚úì *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

‚ùå **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ‚úì *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

‚ùå **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ‚úì *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

‚ùå **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ‚úì *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

‚ùå **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ‚úì *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
