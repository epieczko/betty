# Name: stakeholder-map

## Executive Summary

The Stakeholder Map is a strategic engagement planning artifact that identifies, analyzes, and categorizes all stakeholders relevant to an initiative or organization, using frameworks like the Power-Interest Grid to determine appropriate engagement strategies. This foundational governance tool visualizes stakeholder influence, concerns, communication preferences, and engagement cadence, enabling Engineering Managers, Product Leaders, and Program Managers to build support, manage resistance, and ensure critical stakeholders are appropriately involved throughout the initiative lifecycle.

Building on stakeholder analysis methodologies including RACI for stakeholder roles, Power-Interest matrices (Keep Satisfied, Manage Closely, Monitor, Keep Informed), and influence mapping, this artifact transforms stakeholder complexity into actionable engagement plans. It identifies executive sponsors, decision-makers, influencers, end-users, and blockers, defining tailored communication strategies, meeting cadence, and escalation paths that build alignment, secure buy-in, and navigate organizational politics effectively.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
