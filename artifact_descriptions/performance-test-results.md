# Name: performance-test-results

## Executive Summary

The Performance Test Results artifact documents comprehensive load test execution outcomes, response time distributions (P50/P90/P95/P99 percentiles), throughput metrics (requests per second, transactions per second), error rates, and Apdex scores from performance testing tools such as JMeter, Gatling, k6, Locust, LoadRunner, or BlazeMeter. This artifact enables performance engineers and SRE teams to validate system behavior under load, identify bottlenecks, and ensure applications meet performance SLOs before production deployment.

Performance test results provide quantitative evidence of system capacity, revealing how applications perform under concurrent user loads, sustained traffic patterns, and stress conditions. By capturing detailed metrics across multiple test scenarios, this artifact supports data-driven decisions about infrastructure sizing, code optimizations, and capacity planning investments.

### Strategic Importance

- **Performance Validation**: Validates application meets latency targets (e.g., P95 < 200ms) and throughput requirements (e.g., 1000 RPS)
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Identifies resource constraints (CPU, memory, I/O, network) and application-level performance issues
- **Capacity Planning**: Provides empirical data for infrastructure sizing and scaling policy configuration
- **SLO Verification**: Confirms system meets Service Level Objectives for response times, error rates, and availability
- **Risk Mitigation**: Detects performance regressions and scalability limits before production deployment
- **Cost Optimization**: Informs rightsizing decisions to avoid over-provisioning or under-provisioning resources
- **Continuous Performance**: Enables performance trend analysis and regression detection across releases

**Peer Review**: Have at least one qualified peer review before submitting for approval
**Metadata Completion**: Fully complete all metadata fields to enable search, classification, and lifecycle management
**Stakeholder Validation**: Review draft with key stakeholders before finalizing to ensure alignment and buy-in
**Plain Language**: Write in clear, concise language appropriate for the intended audience; avoid unnecessary jargon
**Visual Communication**: Include diagrams, charts, and tables to communicate complex information more effectively
**Traceability**: Reference source materials, related documents, and dependencies to provide context and enable navigation
**Regular Updates**: Review and update on scheduled cadence or when triggered by significant changes
**Approval Evidence**: Maintain clear record of who approved, when, and any conditions or caveats
**Distribution Management**: Clearly communicate where artifact is published and notify stakeholders of updates
**Retention Compliance**: Follow organizational retention policies for how long to maintain and when to archive/destroy
**Percentile Reporting**: Always report P95 and P99 latencies, not just averages (averages hide tail latency)
**Think Times**: Include realistic think times between requests to model actual user behavior
**Ramp-Up Periods**: Use gradual ramp-up to avoid overwhelming system during test startup
**Baseline Comparison**: Always compare results against baseline to detect performance regressions
**Resource Correlation**: Correlate application metrics with infrastructure utilization to identify bottlenecks
**Error Analysis**: Investigate all error types; high throughput with errors is not successful performance
**Apdex Configuration**: Set appropriate Apdex thresholds (T) based on user experience requirements
**Distribution Analysis**: Review full response time distribution, not just percentiles, to understand behavior patterns

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
