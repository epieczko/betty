# Name: market-analysis

## Executive Summary

The Market Analysis is a comprehensive research and intelligence artifact that defines the addressable market opportunity, competitive landscape, market trends, customer segments, and strategic positioning insights that inform product strategy and go-to-market decisions. This artifact employs rigorous frameworks including TAM/SAM/SOM market sizing, competitive analysis, buyer persona development, and market segmentation to provide a data-driven foundation for strategic planning.
