# Name: test-strategy

## Executive Summary

The Test Strategy artifact defines the comprehensive testing approach, methodologies, test levels, test types, tools, metrics, and resource allocation across the software development lifecycle following ISTQB standards and ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 guidelines. It establishes the test pyramid strategy (70% unit tests, 20% integration tests, 10% end-to-end tests), shift-left testing practices, continuous testing integration, risk-based test prioritization, and quality metrics including code coverage targets (80%+), defect density goals (<1 per KLOC), and mean time to detect/repair thresholds.

As the master testing governance document, this artifact serves QA managers, test leads, development managers, product owners, and executive leadership who need to understand testing scope, approach, resource requirements, timeline, and success criteria. The strategy encompasses unit testing (JUnit, Jest, pytest), integration testing (API testing with REST Assured, Postman), system testing (functional, usability, security), end-to-end testing (Selenium, Cypress, Playwright), non-functional testing (performance with JMeter/Gatling, security with OWASP ZAP, accessibility with axe), test automation framework selection, test environment strategy, defect management workflow, test data management approach, entry/exit criteria per test phase, and continuous testing in CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).

### Strategic Importance

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

❌ **Incomplete Information**: Rushing to complete without gathering all necessary inputs
   ✓ *Solution*: Create comprehensive checklist of required information; allocate sufficient time

❌ **Lack of Stakeholder Input**: Creating in isolation without engaging affected parties
   ✓ *Solution*: Identify all stakeholders early; schedule working sessions for collaborative development

❌ **Outdated Content**: Using old information or not updating when conditions change
   ✓ *Solution*: Establish refresh schedule; define triggers requiring immediate update

❌ **Inconsistent Format**: Not following organizational templates and standards
   ✓ *Solution*: Always start from approved template; verify against style guide before submission

❌ **Missing Approvals**: Publishing without proper authorization
   ✓ *Solution*: Understand approval chain; route through all required approvers with evidence

❌ **Poor Version Control**: Making changes without maintaining history
   ✓ *Solution*: Use proper version control system; never directly edit published version

❌ **Inadequate Distribution**: Completing artifact but stakeholders unaware it exists
   ✓ *Solution*: Define distribution list; actively communicate availability and location

❌ **No Maintenance Plan**: Creating artifact as one-time activity with no ongoing ownership
   ✓ *Solution*: Assign owner; schedule regular reviews; define update triggers
