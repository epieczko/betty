You may retry failed operations or adjust your\napproach based on feedback.\n\n## AVAILABLE SKILLS\nYou have access to the following Betty skills:\n  \u2022 skill.create\n  \u2022 skill.define\n  \u2022 artifact.define\n\n## TASK\nCreate the test.validation skill based on the skill description in skill_descriptions/test.validation.md\n\n## INSTRUCTIONS\nAnalyze the task above and respond with a JSON object describing your execution plan:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Brief analysis of the task\",\n  \"skills_to_invoke\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skill.name\",\n      \"purpose\": \"Why this skill is needed\",\n      \"inputs\": {\"param\": \"value\"},\n      \"order\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explanation of your approach\"\n}\n\nSelect skills from your available skills list and arrange them according to the\nworkflow pattern.
