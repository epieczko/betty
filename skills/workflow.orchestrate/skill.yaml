  planning, deployment planning, and full SDLC cycles.

- 'workflow_type (string, required): Type of workflow to execute (project-initiation,
  security-review, data-design, test-planning, deployment-planning, full-sdlc)'
- 'description (string, required): Initiative or project description for context'
- 'output_directory (string, required): Directory where all workflow artifacts will

  status'
- All artifacts specified by the workflow type (e.g., business-case, project-charter,
  etc.)
- None (initiates workflows from user context)
- workflow-execution-report
- artifact-manifest
- Plus all artifacts specified by the chosen workflow type
- filesystem:read
- filesystem:write
- artifact.create skill (to create individual artifacts)
- artifact.validate skill (to validate created artifacts)
- Template files in templates/ directory
- Call artifact.create with appropriate type and context
- Call artifact.validate to check quality
- Track created artifacts and validation results
- Handle missing dependencies gracefully
- Continue workflow even if individual artifacts fail
- Report all failures in execution report
- Return overall success based on whether any artifacts were created
