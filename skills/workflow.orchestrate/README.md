# workflow.orchestrate

Orchestrate multi-artifact workflows by coordinating specialized agents and artifact creation skills. Creates complete artifact sets for complex initiatives by managing dependencies, sequencing work, and ensuring artifact consistency. Supports common SDLC workflows like project initiation, security reviews, data design, test planning, deployment planning, and full SDLC cycles.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Orchestrate multi-artifact workflows by coordinating specialized agents and artifact creation skills.

  --description_(string,_required):_initiative_or_project_description_for_context "value" \
  --output_directory_(string,_required):_directory_where_all_workflow_artifacts_will_be_created "value" \
  --author_(string,_optional):_author_name_for_generated_artifacts_(default:_"workflow_orchestrator") "value" \
  --classification_(string,_optional):_classification_level_(public,_internal,_confidential,_restricted,_default:_internal) "value" \
  --output-format json
```

## Inputs

- **workflow_type (string, required): Type of workflow to execute (project-initiation, security-review, data-design, test-planning, deployment-planning, full-sdlc)**
- **description (string, required): Initiative or project description for context**
- **output_directory (string, required): Directory where all workflow artifacts will be created**
- **author (string, optional): Author name for generated artifacts (default: "Workflow Orchestrator")**
- **classification (string, optional): Classification level (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted, default: Internal)**

## Outputs

- **workflow-execution-report: Complete workflow execution report with all generated artifacts**
- **artifact-manifest: Manifest of all created artifacts with paths and validation status**
- **All artifacts specified by the workflow type (e.g., business-case, project-charter, etc.)**
- **None (initiates workflows from user context)**
- **workflow-execution-report**
- **artifact-manifest**
- **Plus all artifacts specified by the chosen workflow type**
- **filesystem:read**
- **filesystem:write**
- **artifact.create skill (to create individual artifacts)**
- **artifact.validate skill (to validate created artifacts)**
- **Template files in templates/ directory**
- **Call artifact.create with appropriate type and context**
- **Call artifact.validate to check quality**
- **Track created artifacts and validation results**
- **Handle missing dependencies gracefully**
- **Continue workflow even if individual artifacts fail**
- **Report all failures in execution report**
- **Return overall success based on whether any artifacts were created**
