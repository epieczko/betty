# language.vhdl

Fluency in VHDL hardware description language, encompassing entity-architecture design, concurrent and sequential statements, signal vs variable semantics, process sensitivity lists, state machines, testbenches, and synthesis vs simulation. Mastery of timing models, generics, component instantiation, and FPGA/ASIC design patterns. Understanding of hardware parallelism, delta cycles, and register-transfer level design.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in VHDL hardware description language, encompassing entity-architecture design, concurrent and sequential statements, signal vs variable semantics, process sensitivity lists, state machines, testbenches, and synthesis vs simulation.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive VHDL fluency including: entity declarations defining interfaces, architecture bodies defining behavior or structure, concurrent signal assignments, process blocks with sensitivity lists, signals vs variables (scope and assignment), sequential statements within processes, if-then-else and case statements, for-generate and if-generate for conditional hardware, component declarations and instantiation, port maps for connections, generics for parameterization, libraries and packages (IEEE.std_logic_1164, numeric_std), std_logic and std_logic_vector types, resolved types and resolution functions, delta cycles and simulation semantics, wait statements, clock and reset design patterns, finite state machines (FSM) with state encoding, synchronous vs asynchronous design, setup and hold time analysis, testbenches with assert statements, file I/O for testbenches, synthesis attributes and pragmas, RTL design methodology, and differences between simulation and synthesis semantics.
