description: Fluency in VHDL hardware description language, encompassing entity-architecture
  design, concurrent and sequential statements, signal vs variable semantics, process
  sensitivity lists, state machines, testbenches, and synthesis vs simulation. Mastery
  of timing models, generics, component instantiation, and FPGA/ASIC design patterns.
  Understanding of hardware parallelism, delta cycles, and register-transfer level
  design.
