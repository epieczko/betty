# language.kotlin

Fluency in Kotlin programming language, encompassing null safety, extension functions, data classes, sealed classes, coroutines, smart casts, delegation, reified generics, and operator overloading. Mastery of functional programming features including higher-order functions, lambdas with receivers, scope functions, collection operations, and sequences. Understanding of interoperability with Java, DSL construction, and coroutine contexts.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in Kotlin programming language, encompassing null safety, extension functions, data classes, sealed classes, coroutines, smart casts, delegation, reified generics, and operator overloading.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Kotlin fluency including: null safety with nullable and non-nullable types, safe calls and Elvis operator, extension functions and properties, data classes with automatic equals/hashCode/toString, sealed classes and when expressions, object declarations and companion objects, lambda expressions with implicit it, higher-order functions and function types, scope functions (let, run, with, apply, also), coroutines for async programming with suspend functions, channels and flows, smart casts after type checks, delegation patterns (by keyword), inline functions and reified type parameters, operator overloading, DSL builders with lambdas and receivers, destructuring declarations, and JVM interoperability considerations.
