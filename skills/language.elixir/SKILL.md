# language.elixir

Fluency in Elixir programming language, encompassing functional programming, immutability, pattern matching, processes, message passing, OTP behaviors, supervisors, GenServers, and fault tolerance. Mastery of the pipe operator, protocols, macros for metaprogramming, comprehensions, and the BEAM virtual machine. Understanding of concurrency via lightweight processes, "let it crash" philosophy, and building scalable concurrent applications.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in Elixir programming language, encompassing functional programming, immutability, pattern matching, processes, message passing, OTP behaviors, supervisors, GenServers, and fault tolerance.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Elixir fluency including: immutable data structures, pattern matching in function clauses and case statements, the pipe operator (|>) for function composition, processes and spawn for concurrency, message passing with send and receive, Process.link and Process.monitor, OTP behaviors (GenServer, GenStage, Supervisor), fault tolerance and supervision trees, "let it crash" philosophy, protocols for polymorphism, structs and maps, keyword lists vs maps, the with construct for nested operations, comprehensions for data transformation, the Enum and Stream modules, macros and metaprogramming with quote/unquote, the Mix build tool, ExUnit for testing, agents for state management, tasks for async operations, ETS tables for in-memory storage, and BEAM VM characteristics including preemptive scheduling and garbage collection per process.

## Integration

This skill can be used in agents by including it in `skills_available`:

```yaml
name: my.agent
skills_available:
  - language.elixir
```

## Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
pytest skills/language/elixir/test_language_elixir.py -v
```

## Created By
