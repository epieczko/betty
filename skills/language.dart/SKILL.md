# language.dart

Fluency in Dart programming language, encompassing object-oriented programming, sound null safety, async/await, streams, isolates, mixins, extension methods, and strong typing with type inference. Mastery of Dart's collection literals, cascade notation, factory constructors, generics, and the Flutter framework integration. Understanding of ahead-of-time and just-in-time compilation, and building cross-platform applications.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in Dart programming language, encompassing object-oriented programming, sound null safety, async/await, streams, isolates, mixins, extension methods, and strong typing with type inference.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Dart fluency including: sound null safety with nullable (?) and non-nullable types, classes and inheritance, abstract classes and interfaces (implicit), mixins with the with keyword, extension methods for adding functionality to existing types, factory constructors and named constructors, getters and setters, async/await for asynchronous programming, futures and streams, isolates for parallel computing (no shared memory), cascade notation (..) for method chaining, collection literals and collection if/for, generics with covariance, late variables for lazy initialization, const constructors for compile-time constants, typedef for function types, operator overloading, library privacy with underscore prefix, part/part of for file organization, AOT and JIT compilation modes, tree shaking for code size optimization, and integration with Flutter for UI development.
