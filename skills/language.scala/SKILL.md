# language.scala

Fluency in Scala programming language, encompassing object-oriented and functional programming fusion, static typing with type inference, traits, case classes, pattern matching, for-comprehensions, implicits, higher-kinded types, and futures. Mastery of the collections library, type classes, variance annotations, existential types, and functional programming patterns. Understanding of JVM integration, compiler phases, and functional programming libraries like Cats and ZIO.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Scala fluency including: fusion of OOP and FP paradigms, traits as interfaces with implementations, case classes and pattern matching, sealed traits for ADTs, for-comprehensions as monadic operations, Option, Either, and Try for error handling, immutable collections and functional transformations, implicit parameters and implicit conversions, type classes pattern with implicits, higher-kinded types (HKT) and type constructors, variance annotations (covariance +T, contravariance -T), existential types, structural types, self-type annotations, companion objects, futures and promises for async programming, partial functions, currying and partial application, call-by-name vs call-by-value, lazy evaluation with lazy val, type bounds (upper bounds <: and lower bounds >:), path-dependent types, macros and reflection, and integration with functional libraries (Cats, Scalaz, ZIO).
