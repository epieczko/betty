# language.verilog

Fluency in Verilog hardware description language, encompassing module design, always blocks, blocking vs non-blocking assignments, reg vs wire, continuous assignments, behavioral and structural modeling, and timing control. Mastery of SystemVerilog extensions including interfaces, classes, assertions, and advanced verification constructs. Understanding of synthesis, simulation, race conditions, and digital design patterns.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in Verilog hardware description language, encompassing module design, always blocks, blocking vs non-blocking assignments, reg vs wire, continuous assignments, behavioral and structural modeling, and timing control.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Verilog fluency including: module declarations with ports, wire vs reg types, continuous assignments with assign, procedural blocks (always, initial), blocking (=) vs non-blocking (<=) assignments, sensitivity lists (@posedge, @negedge, @*), case, if-else, and conditional operators, for loops and generate blocks, parameters and parameter overriding, task and function definitions, hierarchical design with module instantiation, port connection by name or position, behavioral modeling, structural modeling with primitives, RTL design patterns, finite state machines, clock domain crossing, timing control with # delays, event control, fork-join parallelism, testbench writing, $display, $monitor, and $finish system tasks, file I/O operations, synthesis vs simulation constructs, avoiding latches and race conditions, SystemVerilog extensions (logic type, interfaces, packages, classes, covergroups, assertions, randomization, constrained random verification), and UVM methodology for verification.
