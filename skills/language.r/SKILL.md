# language.r

Fluency in R programming language, encompassing vectorized operations, data frames, statistical computing, functional programming with apply family, formula syntax, S3/S4/R6 object systems, non-standard evaluation, and the tidyverse ecosystem. Mastery of data manipulation with dplyr, visualization with ggplot2, statistical modeling, reproducible research, and R's unique evaluation model. Understanding of environments, lazy evaluation, and metaprogramming with tidy evaluation.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive R fluency including: vectorized operations and recycling rules, data frames and tibbles, lists and atomic vectors, factors for categorical data, the apply family (apply, lapply, sapply, mapply), formula syntax for modeling, S3 generic functions and methods, S4 formal classes, R6 reference classes, non-standard evaluation (NSE) and tidy evaluation, pipe operators (%>% and |>), dplyr for data manipulation, ggplot2 grammar of graphics, statistical distributions and tests, linear and nonlinear modeling, environments and scoping rules, lazy evaluation of function arguments, metaprogramming with substitute/quote/eval, package development with devtools, and R Markdown for reproducible research.
