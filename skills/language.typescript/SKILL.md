# language.typescript

Fluency in TypeScript programming language, encompassing static type system, structural typing, type inference, generics, union and intersection types, type guards, conditional types, mapped types, and type narrowing. Mastery of advanced type features including utility types, template literal types, discriminated unions, type predicates, and declaration merging. Understanding of compiler options, module resolution, and integration with JavaScript ecosystems.
