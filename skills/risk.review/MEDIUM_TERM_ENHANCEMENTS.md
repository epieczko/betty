# Medium-Term Enhancements - risk.review Skill

**Implementation Date:** 2025-11-01
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Version:** 1.1.0

---

## Overview

Following the successful implementation of short-term production readiness improvements, this document outlines the medium-term enhancements that have been implemented to improve the risk.review skill's accuracy, transparency, and workflow integration.

---

## 1. Hybrid Comparison Mode üîÑ

### Purpose
Allow users to run both AI and regex engines simultaneously and compare their findings to:
- Validate AI assessment accuracy
- Identify gaps in regex pattern coverage
- Build confidence in AI-native approach
- Understand where AI adds value over pattern matching

### Implementation

**New Mode:** `--mode=hybrid`

**Location:** `risk_review.py::_assess_hybrid()`

**Features:**
- Runs both AI and regex assessments in parallel
- Compares findings using normalized text matching
- Calculates agreement metrics
- Identifies unique findings from each engine

### Output

```
HYBRID COMPARISON (AI vs Regex):
  AI Score:           68/100 (HIGH)
  Regex Score:        45/100 (MEDIUM)
  Score Difference:   23 points ‚ö†Ô∏è  Disagreement
  Rating Agreement:   ‚úó No

  AI Findings:        12
  Regex Findings:     8
  Common Findings:    5 (42% overlap)
  AI-Only Findings:   7
  Regex-Only Findings: 3

AI-ONLY FINDINGS (7):
  (Findings detected by AI but not by regex patterns)
  ‚Ä¢ [HIGH] Incomplete incident response plan lacks escalation procedures
    Confidence: 85%
  ‚Ä¢ [HIGH] Third-party data sharing mentioned but no DPA referenced
    Confidence: 78%

REGEX-ONLY FINDINGS (3):
  (Findings detected by regex patterns but not by AI)
  ‚Ä¢ [MEDIUM] Missing audit logging configuration
```

### Usage

```bash
# Run hybrid comparison
/skill/risk/review artifacts/security-policy.yaml --mode=hybrid

# Save comparison results
/skill/risk/review artifacts/config.yaml --mode=hybrid --output comparison.yaml
```

### Value Proposition

- **Validation**: Cross-check AI findings against regex patterns
- **Transparency**: See exactly where AI differs from pattern matching
- **Education**: Learn what semantic understanding adds
- **Debugging**: Identify false positives/negatives

## 2. Metrics & Telemetry System üìä

### Purpose

- Monitor API costs and optimize spending
- Measure cache effectiveness
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Track error rates for quality assurance
- Provide data for continuous improvement

### Implementation

**New Module:** `metrics.py` (500+ lines)

**Key Classes:**
- `MetricsCollector`: Thread-safe metrics collection
- Automatic persistence to `~/.betty/metrics/risk_review/`
- Session-based and historical tracking

### Tracked Metrics

#### Per-Assessment
- Mode used (smart/ai/fast/hybrid)
- Duration (seconds)
- Cost (USD)
- Risk score
- Findings count
- Cache hit/miss
- Errors encountered

#### Aggregated
- Total assessments
- Total cost
- Total duration
- Mode usage distribution
- Cache hit rate
- Error rate
- Average cost per assessment
- Average duration by mode

### Storage

**Session Metrics:** `~/.betty/metrics/risk_review/session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`
**Historical Metrics:** `~/.betty/metrics/risk_review/metrics.json`

### Usage

```bash
# Show session metrics after assessment
/skill/risk/review artifacts/config.yaml --show-metrics

# Show historical metrics (all-time)
/skill/risk/review artifacts/config.yaml --show-historical-metrics
```

### Example Output

### Integration

Metrics are automatically collected on every assessment:
- Assessment duration tracked via timer
- Cache hits/misses recorded
- Errors captured with context
- Metrics saved on program exit (including Ctrl+C)

## 3. Human Review Workflow üë§

### Purpose
Flag low-confidence AI findings for manual review by security professionals to:
- Ensure critical findings are validated by humans
- Build trust in AI assessments
- Create feedback loop for prompt improvement
- Prioritize security expert time effectively

### Implementation

**New Module:** `human_review.py` (400+ lines)

**Key Classes:**
- `HumanReviewQueue`: Thread-safe review queue management
- `ReviewStatus`: Pending/Approved/Rejected/Needs Info
- `ReviewPriority`: Critical/High/Medium/Low

### Automatic Flagging Rules

| Condition | Priority | Reason |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Confidence < 0.7 AND Severity = critical/high | **Critical** | Low confidence, high severity |
| Confidence < 0.7 AND Severity = medium/low | **High** | Low confidence |
| 0.7 ‚â§ Confidence < 0.8 AND Severity = critical/high | **High** | Borderline confidence, high severity |

### Storage

**Review Queue:** `~/.betty/review/risk_review/review_queue.json`

### Usage

```bash
# Run assessment with human review enabled (default)
/skill/risk/review artifacts/security-policy.yaml

# View pending review queue
/skill/risk/review --show-review-queue

# Disable automatic flagging
/skill/risk/review artifacts/config.yaml --disable-human-review
```

### Example Output

**During Assessment:**
```
RECOMMENDATION:
  üü† HIGH RISK - Significant risks identified. Address before production deployment.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED:
  3 finding(s) flagged for manual review
  üî¥ 1 critical priority (low confidence, high severity)
  üü† 2 high priority (low/borderline confidence)

  Use --show-review-queue to view pending reviews
================================================================================
```

**Review Queue Display:**
```
================================================================================
PENDING HUMAN REVIEWS (Showing 3 of 3)
================================================================================

üî¥ Review #1 - review_20251101_142345_0
   Priority: CRITICAL
   Artifact: /path/to/security-policy.yaml
   Timestamp: 2025-11-01T14:23:45
   Reason: Low confidence score (65%)

   Finding: [CRITICAL] Hardcoded credentials detected in configuration
   Confidence: 65%
   Evidence: password: "admin123"
   Impact: Unauthorized access, credential exposure

üü† Review #2 - review_20251101_142345_1
   Priority: HIGH
   Artifact: /path/to/security-policy.yaml
   Timestamp: 2025-11-01T14:23:46
   Reason: Borderline confidence (75%) on high severity finding

   Finding: [HIGH] Unclear authentication implementation
   Confidence: 75%
   Evidence: "Authentication will be handled by OAuth"
   Impact: Potential access control gaps

================================================================================
```

### Workflow

1. **Automatic Flagging**: Low-confidence findings auto-flagged during assessment
2. **Review Queue**: Findings stored in persistent queue with priority
3. **Manual Review**: Security professional reviews flagged findings
4. **Status Update**: Mark as approved/rejected/needs-info
5. **Feedback Loop**: Use reviewed findings to improve prompts

### API for Review Management

```python
from human_review import get_review_queue, ReviewStatus

queue = get_review_queue()

# Get pending reviews by priority
critical_reviews = queue.get_pending_reviews(priority=ReviewPriority.CRITICAL)

# Mark finding as reviewed
queue.mark_reviewed(
    review_id="review_20251101_142345_0",
    status=ReviewStatus.APPROVED,
    reviewed_by="security@company.com",
    notes="Confirmed - hardcoded password found in dev config"
)

# Get summary
summary = queue.get_review_summary()
# {
#   'total_items': 15,
#   'pending': 3,
#   'approved': 10,
#   'rejected': 2,
#   'needs_info': 0,
#   'pending_by_priority': {'critical': 1, 'high': 2, 'medium': 0, 'low': 0}
# }

# Export reviews
queue.export_reviews(Path("reviews.json"), status=ReviewStatus.PENDING)
```

## Combined Impact

### Before Medium-Term Enhancements
- AI assessment: Black box (can't compare to baseline)
- Cost tracking: Estimates only
- Low-confidence findings: No mechanism to flag for review
- Usage patterns: Unknown

### After Medium-Term Enhancements
- AI assessment: Validated against regex baseline (hybrid mode)
- Cost tracking: Actual costs, historical trends, cache effectiveness
- Low-confidence findings: Automatic flagging with priority
- Usage patterns: Full visibility into costs, performance, errors
