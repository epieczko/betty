# language.fortran

Fluency in Fortran programming language, encompassing array operations, numerical computing, column-major layout, modules, derived types, procedure pointers, coarrays for parallel programming, and intrinsic functions. Mastery of modern Fortran features including object-oriented programming, interoperability with C, and high-performance computing patterns. Understanding of Fortran's evolution, fixed vs free format, and scientific computing optimization.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in Fortran programming language, encompassing array operations, numerical computing, column-major layout, modules, derived types, procedure pointers, coarrays for parallel programming, and intrinsic functions.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Fortran fluency including: array operations and array slicing, column-major memory layout, intrinsic functions for mathematics, modules for encapsulation and namespaces, derived types (user-defined types), type-bound procedures for OOP, abstract types and polymorphism, procedure pointers and function pointers, interfaces and generic procedures, pure and elemental procedures, intent attributes (in, out, inout) for arguments, allocatable arrays and automatic deallocation, coarrays for parallel programming (PGAS model), do concurrent for parallel loops, OpenMP and MPI integration, interoperability with C (ISO_C_BINDING), fixed format (F77) vs free format (F90+), implicit none for explicit typing, common blocks (legacy) vs modules, complex number support, logical operations, formatted and unformatted I/O, and optimization for numerical computing and HPC.
