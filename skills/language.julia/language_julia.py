language.julia - Fluency in Julia programming language, encompassing multiple dispatch, type system with parametric types, just-in-time compilation, metaprogramming with macros, performance-oriented design, optional typing, and scientific computing patterns. Mastery of broadcasting, vectorization, parallel computing, array programming, and composability. Understanding of type stability, specialization, and achieving C-like performance with high-level syntax.
