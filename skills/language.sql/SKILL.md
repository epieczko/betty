# language.sql

Fluency in SQL programming language, encompassing relational algebra, query optimization, joins, subqueries, window functions, common table expressions, indexes, transactions, isolation levels, and normalization. Mastery of advanced query patterns including recursive CTEs, pivot operations, aggregate functions with grouping, and query execution plans. Understanding of ACID properties, locking mechanisms, and database-specific SQL dialects.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive SQL fluency including: SELECT statements with WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS), self-joins and multiple joins, subqueries (scalar, column, row, table), correlated subqueries, EXISTS vs IN, window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, LAG, LEAD), partitioning and framing, common table expressions (CTEs) and recursive CTEs, aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX), CASE expressions, UNION vs UNION ALL, set operations (INTERSECT, EXCEPT), indexes and their types (B-tree, hash, GiST), query execution plans and EXPLAIN, transactions and ACID properties, isolation levels (READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, SERIALIZABLE), locking and concurrency control, constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK), normalization forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF), and stored procedures and triggers.
