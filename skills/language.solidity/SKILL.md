# language.solidity

Fluency in Solidity programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, encompassing contract structure, state variables, functions, modifiers, events, inheritance, interfaces, libraries, and gas optimization. Mastery of security patterns, reentrancy guards, access control, upgrade patterns, and common vulnerabilities. Understanding of EVM execution, storage vs memory vs calldata, and decentralized application development.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in Solidity programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, encompassing contract structure, state variables, functions, modifiers, events, inheritance, interfaces, libraries, and gas optimization. Mastery of security patterns, reentrancy guards, access control, upgrade patterns, and common vulnerabilities. Understanding of EVM execution, storage vs memory vs calldata, and decentralized application development.

**Command:** `/language/solidity`

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python3 skills/language/solidity/language_solidity.py
```

### With Arguments

python3 skills/language/solidity/language_solidity.py \
  --code_file "value" \
  --validation_type "value" \
  --output-format json
```

## Inputs

- **code_file**
- **validation_type**

## Outputs

- **language_metadata.json**
- **validation_report.json**

## Artifact Metadata

### Produces

- `language-metadata`
- `code-analysis`

## Permissions

- `filesystem:read`

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Solidity fluency including: contract declarations and constructors, state variables and their visibility (public, private, internal, external), functions and function visibility, pure, view, and payable modifiers, custom modifiers for access control and validation, events and indexed parameters for logging, inheritance and overriding, abstract contracts and interfaces, libraries and using-for declarations, storage vs memory vs calldata data locations, value types (uint, bool, address, bytes) vs reference types (arrays, structs, mappings), mappings and nested mappings, arrays (fixed and dynamic), structs for complex data, error handling (require, assert, revert), try-catch blocks, fallback and receive functions, gas optimization techniques, storage packing, external calls and delegatecall, reentrancy attacks and prevention (Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, ReentrancyGuard), integer overflow/underflow (SafeMath), access control patterns (Ownable, Role-Based Access Control), upgrade patterns (proxy patterns, transparent proxies), and security best practices (SWC registry vulnerabilities).
