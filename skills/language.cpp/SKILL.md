# language.cpp

Fluency in C++ programming language, encompassing object-oriented and generic programming, RAII, move semantics, perfect forwarding, template metaprogramming, smart pointers, standard library containers and algorithms, and modern C++ features. Mastery of memory management, undefined behavior, the rule of three/five/zero, constexpr, concepts, ranges, and compile-time computation. Understanding of compilation model, linking, ABI compatibility, and zero-overhead principle.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in C++ programming language, encompassing object-oriented and generic programming, RAII, move semantics, perfect forwarding, template metaprogramming, smart pointers, standard library containers and algorithms, and modern C++ features. Mastery of memory management, undefined behavior, the rule of three/five/zero, constexpr, concepts, ranges, and compile-time computation. Understanding of compilation model, linking, ABI compatibility, and zero-overhead principle.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive C++ fluency including: OOP with virtual functions and dynamic dispatch, templates and template specialization, SFINAE and type traits, move semantics with rvalue references, perfect forwarding with universal references, smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr), RAII for resource management, the rule of three/five/zero, STL containers and their complexity guarantees, algorithms and iterators, lambda expressions and captures, constexpr and compile-time evaluation, concepts (C++20) for template constraints, ranges library, coroutines, structured bindings, std::variant and std::optional, memory model and atomics, undefined behavior pitfalls, compilation phases and linkage, and modern C++ best practices (C++11/14/17/20/23).
