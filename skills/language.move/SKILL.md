# language.move

Fluency in Move programming language for blockchain smart contracts, encompassing resource-oriented programming, linear types, modules, structs with abilities, generics, references, and formal verification support. Mastery of resource safety guarantees, no-copy/no-drop semantics, account-based storage model, and secure digital asset management. Understanding of the Move VM, bytecode verification, and building safe blockchain applications.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in Move programming language for blockchain smart contracts, encompassing resource-oriented programming, linear types, modules, structs with abilities, generics, references, and formal verification support.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Move fluency including: resource-oriented programming paradigm, linear types preventing duplication and implicit destruction, structs with abilities (copy, drop, store, key), resources as first-class assets, modules for code organization, public and internal function visibility, generics with phantom type parameters, references (immutable & and mutable &mut), borrow checking at bytecode level, move and copy semantics, account-based storage model, global storage operators (move_to, move_from, borrow_global, exists), script vs module distinction, transaction scripts for orchestration, native functions for system operations, assert and abort for error handling, formal verification with the Move Prover, specification language for invariants and conditions, vector operations, signer type for authentication, address type for account references, no implicit copies preventing asset duplication, no dangling resources ensuring asset safety, type safety guarantees, and applications in Diem/Aptos/Sui blockchains.
