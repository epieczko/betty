# language.lua

Fluency in Lua programming language, encompassing tables as the universal data structure, first-class functions, closures, coroutines, metatables, metamethods, lexical scoping, and embeddability. Mastery of Lua's minimalist design, pattern matching, the module system, and C API for integration. Understanding of Lua's implementation, lightweight nature, and use as an embedded scripting language.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in Lua programming language, encompassing tables as the universal data structure, first-class functions, closures, coroutines, metatables, metamethods, lexical scoping, and embeddability.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Lua fluency including: tables as arrays, dictionaries, and objects, 1-based indexing, first-class functions and closures, lexical scoping and upvalues, coroutines with yield and resume, metatables and metamethods (__index, __newindex, __add, __call, etc.), implementing OOP with tables and metatables, varargs and multiple return values, string library and pattern matching (not full regex), iterators (pairs, ipairs, custom iterators), modules and require, local vs global variables, weak tables for caching, the string interning mechanism, garbage collection, C API for embedding and extending Lua, userdata and light userdata, LuaJIT for performance, and use in game development, embedded systems, and configuration.
