# language.haskell

Fluency in Haskell programming language, encompassing pure functional programming, lazy evaluation, strong static typing, type inference, higher-order functions, monads, functors, applicatives, algebraic data types, type classes, and parametric polymorphism. Mastery of monad transformers, lens libraries, parser combinators, and equational reasoning. Understanding of category theory concepts, laziness implications, and type-level programming.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Haskell fluency including: pure functions and referential transparency, lazy evaluation and thunks, algebraic data types (ADTs) with sum and product types, pattern matching and guards, type classes (Eq, Ord, Show, Functor, Applicative, Monad), higher-order functions (map, filter, fold), lambda expressions and currying, partial application, function composition, list comprehensions, the Maybe and Either types for error handling, IO monad and do-notation, monad laws and monad transformers, functors and applicative functors, monoids and semigroups, type inference with Hindley-Milner, parametric polymorphism vs ad-hoc polymorphism, type synonyms and newtype, GADTs and type families, phantom types, existential quantification, lens and optics, parser combinators with Parsec, QuickCheck for property testing, and equational reasoning.
