# language.swift

Fluency in Swift programming language, encompassing value semantics, protocol-oriented programming, optionals, automatic reference counting, type inference, generics, closures, error handling, and memory safety. Mastery of protocols with extensions, associated types, property wrappers, result builders, actors for concurrency, and Swift's type system. Understanding of copy-on-write optimization, ARC vs manual memory management, and interoperability with Objective-C.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in Swift programming language, encompassing value semantics, protocol-oriented programming, optionals, automatic reference counting, type inference, generics, closures, error handling, and memory safety.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Swift fluency including: optionals with if-let and guard-let bindings, optional chaining and nil coalescing, value types (struct, enum) vs reference types (class), protocol-oriented programming with protocol extensions, associated types and generic constraints, automatic reference counting (ARC) and weak/unowned references, closures and capturing semantics, trailing closure syntax, error handling with throws/try/catch, Result type, generics with where clauses, property observers (willSet, didSet), property wrappers (@State, @Published, etc.), computed properties, subscripts, extensions, type inference and explicit typing, pattern matching with switch, guard statements, defer statements, actors and structured concurrency (Swift 5.5+), async/await, copy-on-write for collections, and Swift-Objective-C bridging.
