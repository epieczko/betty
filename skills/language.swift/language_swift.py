language.swift - Fluency in Swift programming language, encompassing value semantics, protocol-oriented programming, optionals, automatic reference counting, type inference, generics, closures, error handling, and memory safety. Mastery of protocols with extensions, associated types, property wrappers, result builders, actors for concurrency, and Swift's type system. Understanding of copy-on-write optimization, ARC vs manual memory management, and interoperability with Objective-C.
