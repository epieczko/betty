# language.assembly

Fluency in Assembly programming language, encompassing CPU architecture, registers, memory addressing modes, instruction sets, stack operations, calling conventions, and low-level optimization. Mastery of different assembly syntaxes (Intel, AT&T), system calls, interrupts, bit manipulation, and hardware interaction. Understanding of instruction encoding, pipelining, caches, and writing performance-critical code at the lowest abstraction level.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in Assembly programming language, encompassing CPU architecture, registers, memory addressing modes, instruction sets, stack operations, calling conventions, and low-level optimization.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Assembly fluency including: CPU registers (general-purpose, special-purpose, segment registers), instruction sets (x86, x86-64, ARM, MIPS, RISC-V), memory addressing modes (immediate, register, direct, indirect, indexed, base+offset), data movement instructions (MOV, LEA, PUSH, POP), arithmetic and logic operations (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, AND, OR, XOR, NOT), control flow (JMP, conditional jumps, CALL, RET), comparison and test operations (CMP, TEST), stack frame setup and teardown, calling conventions (cdecl, stdcall, fastcall, System V AMD64 ABI), parameter passing (stack vs registers), function prologues and epilogues, inline assembly in high-level languages, system calls and interrupts, bit manipulation and shifts, floating-point operations (x87, SSE, AVX), SIMD instructions for parallelism, memory barriers and atomics, instruction encoding and machine code, alignment and cache considerations, branch prediction hints, loop unrolling, instruction-level parallelism, and debugging with disassembly and debuggers.
