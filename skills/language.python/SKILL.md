# language.python

Fluency in Python programming language, encompassing dynamic typing, object-oriented and functional paradigms, comprehensions, decorators, context managers, generators, async/await concurrency, duck typing, and Pythonic idioms. Mastery of Python's data model including dunder methods, metaclasses, descriptors, and the import system. Understanding of memory management, GIL implications, and performance optimization strategies.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in Python programming language, encompassing dynamic typing, object-oriented and functional paradigms, comprehensions, decorators, context managers, generators, async/await concurrency, duck typing, and Pythonic idioms.
