# language.csharp

Fluency in C# programming language, encompassing object-oriented design, LINQ, async/await, delegates, events, properties, indexers, extension methods, pattern matching, records, nullable reference types, and expression trees. Mastery of .NET runtime, garbage collection, value vs reference types, generics with constraints, reflection, attributes, and asynchronous programming patterns. Understanding of compilation to IL, JIT compilation, and CLR fundamentals.
