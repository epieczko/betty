# language.ruby

Fluency in Ruby programming language, encompassing object-oriented design with open classes, mixins, blocks and yields, metaprogramming, duck typing, symbols, modules, eigenclasses, method_missing, and the principle of least surprise. Mastery of Ruby's enumerable methods, procs vs lambdas, refinements, DSL creation, and Rails conventions. Understanding of Ruby's method lookup chain, singleton methods, and dynamic method definition.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in Ruby programming language, encompassing object-oriented design with open classes, mixins, blocks and yields, metaprogramming, duck typing, symbols, modules, eigenclasses, method_missing, and the principle of least surprise. Mastery of Ruby's enumerable methods, procs vs lambdas, refinements, DSL creation, and Rails conventions. Understanding of Ruby's method lookup chain, singleton methods, and dynamic method definition.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Ruby fluency including: everything is an object philosophy, open classes and monkey patching, blocks, procs, and lambdas with their differences, yield keyword and block_given?, enumerable methods (map, select, reduce, etc.), symbols vs strings, modules as mixins, include vs extend vs prepend, method lookup chain and ancestors, singleton methods and eigenclasses (metaclasses), method_missing for dynamic dispatch, define_method for metaprogramming, refinements for scoped monkey patching, attr_accessor/reader/writer, duck typing and respond_to?, exception handling with begin/rescue/ensure, regular expressions with capture groups, string interpolation, splat operators, keyword arguments, and DSL construction patterns.
