# language.java

Fluency in Java programming language, encompassing object-oriented design, strong static typing, JVM architecture, garbage collection, memory model, concurrency utilities, reflection, generics with type erasure, lambdas, streams API, and module system. Mastery of design patterns, SOLID principles, exception handling, serialization, annotations, and enterprise patterns. Understanding of bytecode, JIT compilation, classloading, and performance optimization.

## Overview

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Java fluency including: OOP principles with encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces (including default and static methods), generics with bounded type parameters and wildcards, lambda expressions and functional interfaces, Stream API and Optional, exception handling hierarchy (checked vs unchecked), collections framework and concurrent collections, Java Memory Model and volatile/synchronized, thread-safe programming with java.util.concurrent, reflection and introspection, annotations and annotation processing, serialization mechanisms, module system (Java 9+), garbage collection algorithms, and JVM tuning.
