# language.javascript

Fluency in JavaScript programming language, encompassing prototypal inheritance, event-driven architecture, asynchronous programming with promises and async/await, closures, hoisting, scope chains, the event loop, and execution contexts. Mastery of ES6+ features including arrow functions, destructuring, spread operators, modules, classes, symbols, iterators, generators, and proxy objects. Understanding of this binding, prototype chain, and functional programming patterns.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in JavaScript programming language, encompassing prototypal inheritance, event-driven architecture, asynchronous programming with promises and async/await, closures, hoisting, scope chains, the event loop, and execution contexts. Mastery of ES6+ features including arrow functions, destructuring, spread operators, modules, classes, symbols, iterators, generators, and proxy objects. Understanding of this binding, prototype chain, and functional programming patterns.

**Command:** `/language/javascript`

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive JavaScript fluency including: prototypal inheritance vs classical inheritance, event loop and microtask queue, promise chain and async/await patterns, closures and lexical scoping, hoisting of var/let/const/function, this binding rules (implicit, explicit, new, arrow), ES modules vs CommonJS, array and object manipulation methods, functional programming with map/filter/reduce, destructuring and spread operators, template literals, arrow functions and lexical this, WeakMap and WeakSet for memory management, and modern ECMAScript features.
