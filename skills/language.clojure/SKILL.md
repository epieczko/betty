# language.clojure

Fluency in Clojure programming language, encompassing functional programming, immutability, persistent data structures, REPL-driven development, Lisp syntax with homoiconicity, macros, multimethods, protocols, transducers, and software transactional memory. Mastery of sequence abstraction, destructuring, spec for data validation, and concurrent programming with atoms, refs, agents. Understanding of JVM interoperability and code-as-data philosophy.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in Clojure programming language, encompassing functional programming, immutability, persistent data structures, REPL-driven development, Lisp syntax with homoiconicity, macros, multimethods, protocols, transducers, and software transactional memory. Mastery of sequence abstraction, destructuring, spec for data validation, and concurrent programming with atoms, refs, agents. Understanding of JVM interoperability and code-as-data philosophy.

**Command:** `/language/clojure`

## Usage

### Basic Usage

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Clojure fluency including: immutable persistent data structures (vectors, maps, sets, lists), sequence abstraction and lazy sequences, higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, comp), destructuring in let and function parameters, threading macros (-> and ->>), functional composition, pure functions and side effects management, atoms for synchronous independent state, refs and STM for coordinated synchronous state, agents for asynchronous independent state, vars and dynamic binding, protocols for polymorphism, multimethods for complex dispatch, macros and metaprogramming, homoiconicity and code-as-data, the reader and evaluation model, spec for data specification and validation, transducers for composable transformations, core.async for CSP-style concurrency, JVM interoperability with Java classes, REPL-driven development workflow, namespace management, and ClojureScript for JavaScript targets.

## Integration

This skill can be used in agents by including it in `skills_available`:

```yaml
name: my.agent
skills_available:
  - language.clojure
```

## Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
pytest skills/language/clojure/test_language_clojure.py -v
```

## Created By

This skill was generated by **meta.skill**, the skill creator meta-agent.
