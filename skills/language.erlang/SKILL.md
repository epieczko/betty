# language.erlang

Fluency in Erlang programming language, encompassing concurrent programming with lightweight processes, message passing, pattern matching, functional programming, immutability, fault tolerance, hot code swapping, and OTP framework. Mastery of supervisors, gen_server, gen_fsm, gen_event, distribution, and building highly available systems. Understanding of BEAM VM, scheduler, process isolation, and "let it crash" error handling philosophy.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Erlang fluency including: lightweight processes and spawn, message passing with ! (send) and receive, pattern matching in function clauses and receive blocks, immutable data structures (lists, tuples, maps), recursion and tail-call optimization, higher-order functions, atoms and binaries, guards in function clauses, list comprehensions, OTP behaviors (gen_server, supervisor, gen_fsm, gen_event, gen_statem), supervision trees and restart strategies, fault tolerance and "let it crash", links and monitors for process relationships, distributed Erlang and node communication, hot code swapping and release handling, ETS and DETS tables, Mnesia distributed database, the BEAM VM and preemptive scheduling, process isolation and per-process garbage collection, BIFs (built-in functions), pattern matching binaries for parsing, and building telecom-grade reliability systems.
