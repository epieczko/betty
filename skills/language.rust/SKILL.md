# language.rust

Fluency in Rust programming language, encompassing ownership system, borrowing and lifetimes, zero-cost abstractions, memory safety without garbage collection, trait system, pattern matching, error handling with Result and Option, macro system, and fearless concurrency. Mastery of advanced concepts including lifetime elision, smart pointers, interior mutability, unsafe code blocks, and procedural macros. Understanding of compiler guarantees, zero-copy operations, and systems programming patterns.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in Rust programming language, encompassing ownership system, borrowing and lifetimes, zero-cost abstractions, memory safety without garbage collection, trait system, pattern matching, error handling with Result and Option, macro system, and fearless concurrency. Mastery of advanced concepts including lifetime elision, smart pointers, interior mutability, unsafe code blocks, and procedural macros. Understanding of compiler guarantees, zero-copy operations, and systems programming patterns.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Rust fluency including: ownership rules and move semantics, borrowing with shared (&) and mutable (&mut) references, lifetimes and lifetime annotations, lifetime elision rules, trait definitions and implementations, trait bounds and associated types, generics and monomorphization, pattern matching with exhaustiveness checking, Result and Option for error handling, ? operator for error propagation, iterators and iterator adapters, closures and Fn traits, smart pointers (Box, Rc, Arc, RefCell), interior mutability patterns, Send and Sync traits for concurrency, async/await and futures, macro rules and procedural macros, unsafe blocks and raw pointers, FFI and C interoperability, and zero-cost abstractions philosophy.
