language.rust - Fluency in Rust programming language, encompassing ownership system, borrowing and lifetimes, zero-cost abstractions, memory safety without garbage collection, trait system, pattern matching, error handling with Result and Option, macro system, and fearless concurrency. Mastery of advanced concepts including lifetime elision, smart pointers, interior mutability, unsafe code blocks, and procedural macros. Understanding of compiler guarantees, zero-copy operations, and systems programming patterns.
