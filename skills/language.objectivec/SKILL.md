# language.objectivec

Fluency in Objective-C programming language, encompassing message passing, dynamic runtime, categories, protocols, blocks, automatic reference counting, key-value coding, key-value observing, and Foundation framework. Mastery of the runtime system, method swizzling, associated objects, toll-free bridging, and Cocoa design patterns. Understanding of manual memory management, retain/release cycles, and interoperability with C and Swift.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Objective-C fluency including: message passing syntax with square brackets, dynamic typing with id type, protocols (similar to interfaces), categories for extending classes, class extensions, blocks as closures, automatic reference counting (ARC) vs manual retain/release, strong vs weak vs unsafe_unretained references, properties with synthesized accessors, dot notation vs message syntax, key-value coding (KVC) and key-value observing (KVO), the runtime system and introspection, method swizzling and dynamic method resolution, associated objects, designated initializers, toll-free bridging with Core Foundation, NSObject and root class hierarchy, Foundation framework (NSString, NSArray, NSDictionary), collection literals and subscripting, exception handling, @autoreleasepool, nullability annotations (__nullable, __nonnull), generics (lightweight), and Swift interoperability with bridging headers.
