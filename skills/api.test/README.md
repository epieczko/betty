# api.test

Test REST API endpoints by executing HTTP requests and validating responses against expected outcomes

## Overview

**Purpose:** Test REST API endpoints by executing HTTP requests and validating responses against expected outcomes

**Command:** `/api/test`

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python3 skills/api/test/api_test.py
```

### With Arguments

```bash
python3 skills/api/test/api_test.py \
  --api_spec_path "value" \
  --base_url "value" \
  --test_scenarios_path_(optional) "value" \
  --auth_config_path_(optional) "value" \
  --output-format json
```

## Inputs

- **api_spec_path**
- **base_url**
- **test_scenarios_path (optional)**
- **auth_config_path (optional)**

## Outputs

- **test_results.json**
- **test_report.html**

## Artifact Metadata

### Produces

- `test-result`
- `test-report`

## Permissions

- `network:http`
- `filesystem:read`
- `filesystem:write`

## Implementation Notes

Support multiple HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS Test scenarios should validate: - Response status codes - Response headers - Response body structure and content - Response time/performance - Authentication/authorization - Error handling Features: - Load test scenarios from OpenAPI/Swagger specs - Support various authentication methods (Bearer, Basic, API Key, OAuth2) - Execute tests in sequence or parallel - Generate detailed HTML reports with pass/fail visualization - Support environment variables for configuration - Retry failed tests with exponential backoff - Collect performance metrics (response time, throughput) Output should include: - Total tests run - Passed/failed counts - Individual test results with request/response details - Performance statistics - Coverage metrics (% of endpoints tested)
