# language.go

Fluency in Go programming language, encompassing goroutines, channels, select statements, interface composition, structural typing, defer/panic/recover, reflection, and composition over inheritance. Mastery of concurrency patterns including worker pools, pipelines, fan-out/fan-in, context propagation, and cancellation. Understanding of garbage collection, scheduler, memory layout, and idiomatic Go patterns including error handling and package design.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Fluency in Go programming language, encompassing goroutines, channels, select statements, interface composition, structural typing, defer/panic/recover, reflection, and composition over inheritance.

## Implementation Notes

Represents comprehensive Go fluency including: goroutines and concurrent execution, channels for communication (buffered and unbuffered), select statement for channel multiplexing, context package for cancellation and deadlines, interface types and implicit satisfaction, empty interface and type assertions, type switches, defer statements and resource cleanup, panic and recover mechanisms, error handling with multiple return values, composition through embedding, methods on types and pointer receivers, slices vs arrays and slice internals, maps and their properties, reflection with the reflect package, testing with table-driven tests, benchmarking, package organization and internal packages, and the go command ecosystem.
